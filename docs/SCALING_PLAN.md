# PAL100 COMMUNITY SCALING PLAN
## From 100 Objects to 10,000: A Strategic Roadmap

### üéØ Executive Summary

The **Pal100 Community** operates on an urgent, three-phase scaling strategy to comprehensively document Palestinian material culture. Starting with 100 foundational objects, we aim to scale to 1,000 then 10,000 objects, creating the world's most comprehensive archive of Palestinian material culture.

**‚è∞ URGENCY FACTOR**: We recognize the critical importance of preserving what may not survive the current situation. Every day of delay risks permanent loss of cultural artifacts and their stories.
