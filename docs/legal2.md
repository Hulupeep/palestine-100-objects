Short version: a disclaimer like “errors may exist” won’t shield you if you publish a false, reputation-harming statement as a fact. What *does* reduce your risk is (a) publishing verifiable facts with clear sourcing and dating, (b) using opinion carefully and signalling its basis, (c) correcting fast, and (d) relying on recognised legal defenses where they apply.

Here’s a practical, defensible way to write and ship.

# 1) How to phrase risky facts

* **Attribute + date + document type.**
  “**According to** Caterpillar Inc.’s Form 10-K **filed on 28 Feb 2025**, **\[source]**, **the company reported …**”
  “**A shareholder register dated 30 Jun 2024** lists investors A and B; **C is not listed in that register**.”
  This leans on *fair and accurate report of public documents / registers open to inspection*, which can attract **qualified privilege** in Ireland when done fairly and accurately. ([Irish Statute Book][1])
* **Avoid flat assertions you can’t verify.** Prefer “**X was reported by \[outlet] on \[date]**” over “X happened,” unless you’ve verified directly.
* **Separate fact from opinion, and show the basis.** Honest opinion is a defence when you indicate the facts you’re relying on and a reasonable person could hold the opinion from those facts. Use “In my view… because \[stated facts/links].” (IE: Defamation Act 2009 s.20; UK: Defamation Act 2013 s.3). ([rev-acts.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com][2], [Legislation.gov.uk][3])

# 2) Corrections & errata (ship a policy in the book + online)

Include a “**Corrections & Updates**” box in the front-matter and mirror it on a URL you control:

> **Corrections & Updates Policy**
> This book reports facts **as of the publication dates noted** and cites its sources. If you spot an error, please contact **\[email]**. We will investigate and, where warranted, publish a prompt correction in **future printings/editions** and at **\[URL]**. Significant updates will be logged with **date/time**, **what changed**, and **source**.

Prompt corrections aren’t a silver bullet, but they help and align with standard publishing practice (errata/corrigenda) and, in Ireland, can count in your favour on damages. ([www.elsevier.com][4], [Wolters Kluwer][5], [Revised Acts][6])

# 3) If you still get something wrong (Ireland-specific)

Ireland’s Defamation Act 2009 gives you an **“offer to make amends”** route: a written offer to correct, apologise, and (if needed) pay compensation. Using it promptly can limit exposure and affects damages. Have a template ready. ([Irish Statute Book][7], [Law Society of Ireland][8])

**Template (keep handy):**

> **Offer to Make Amends (s.22 Defamation Act 2009)**
> Without admission of liability, we offer to:
>
> 1. Publish a suitable correction and sufficient apology in \[same prominence/format];
> 2. Remove or amend the offending passage from future editions and digital versions;
> 3. Discuss reasonable compensation and costs as provided by s.22–23.

# 4) Public-interest reporting (don’t rely on a throwaway disclaimer)

* **Ireland:** There’s a defence of **fair and reasonable publication on a matter of public interest** (s.26). Historically a high bar; courts examine your *good faith* and whether you made **reasonable checks**. Reform is in motion to clarify this but treat it as stringent: keep a **fact-check log** (who/when/how you verified), and why publication was in the public interest. ([Irish Statute Book][9], [McCann FitzGerald][10], [RDJ LLP][11])
* **UK (if publishing/selling there):** **Public interest defence** (Defamation Act 2013 s.4) turns on whether you reasonably believed publication was in the public interest—again, your **pre-publication diligence file** matters. ([Hamlin's][12])
* **US:** Do **not** assume “neutral reportage” or “it’s my opinion” protects you; recognition varies by state and mere “I think” labels don’t immunize factual implications. ([Reporters Committee][13], [The Free Speech Center][14], [Purdue Global Law School][15])

# 5) What to *put in the book* (safe + useful language)

Use these instead of blanket “we might be wrong” disclaimers:

**Sourcing note (front-matter):**

> **Sources & Dating.** Factual statements in this book are **sourced and dated** in notes. Company holdings, investor lists, and sales figures **change over time**; where relevant we indicate **“as of \[date]”**. Where we quote or summarise **public filings, official registers, or court documents**, we report them **fairly and accurately** and provide citations.

**Attribution pattern (in-text or notes):**

> “As of **30 Jun 2024**, per **\[Company] share register** (publicly filed), investors **A and B** are listed; **C is not listed**.”
> “On **15 May 2025**, **\[Outlet]** reported **2,330 units**; we did not see this figure in the company’s statutory filings.”

**Opinion marker:**

> “**Opinion:** Based on the filings and trade data cited above, **I infer** that … (see notes 12–15).”

# 6) Process that actually reduces risk (and shows “reasonable checks”)

* **Keep a diligence file:** PDFs of the filings/registries, URLs, access dates, emails to companies asking for comment (and their replies/non-replies), and your checklist. This supports s.26 (IE) / s.4 (UK) “reasonable belief” tests. ([Irish Statute Book][9], [Hamlin's][12])
* **Fact labels:** Put “**as of \[date]**” beside anything that can change (investors, contracts, export numbers).
* **Privilege where available:** When reporting **fair and accurate** extracts from court proceedings or official registers, say so and cite them. ([Irish Statute Book][16])
* **Pre-pub legal read** for the sharpest passages (names + numbers + wrongdoing). It’s common and often surgical (just the risky pages). ([Page Two][17])
* **Media liability (E\&O) insurance** if you’re naming companies/people with potentially harmful errors if wrong. ([The Authors Guild][18], [GIJN][19])

## Bottom line for your example

Instead of writing “Caterpillar sold 2,330 bulldozers to Israel and investors are A, B, C,” write:

> “**According to** \[named source] on **\[date]**, **2,330 units** were **reported** as delivered **(we did not find this figure in statutory filings)**. **Caterpillar’s \[document/register] dated \[date]** lists **A and B** among significant shareholders; **C is not listed** in that document.”

If a post-publication change or mistake emerges, **immediately**: (1) correct the text online/next printing + log it at your errata URL; (2) apologise if appropriate; (3) consider an **offer to make amends** under Irish law. ([Irish Statute Book][7], [Revised Acts][6])

I’m not a lawyer; this is general information to help you structure safer publication. Given your topic and jurisdiction (Ireland + likely UK/US reach), I’d budget a short pre-publication legal review of the high-risk pages and set up the corrections page before launch. If you want, I can draft your **front-matter “Sources & Corrections” page** and a **one-page diligence checklist** you can reuse for every chapter.
