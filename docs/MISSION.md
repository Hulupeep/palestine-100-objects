# PAL100 COMMUNITY MISSION STATEMENT

## Our Purpose

**This project is brought to you by the Pal100 community whose objective is to chronicle and distribute the Palestinian experience through material culture.**

## Our Urgent Call

We stand at a critical moment in history. The material culture that tells the story of Palestinian life—objects that carry memory, tradition, and identity—faces unprecedented risk. Every day, artifacts of daily life, family heirlooms, cultural treasures, and the ordinary objects that make up the fabric of Palestinian existence may be lost forever.

We cannot wait. We must act now to create a lasting record of what otherwise may not survive the current situation.

## Our Mission

The Pal100 community is dedicated to the systematic documentation, preservation, and distribution of Palestinian material culture. We believe that objects tell stories that words alone cannot capture—stories of resilience, creativity, adaptation, and the profound humanity that persists in the face of overwhelming challenges.

Our mission is urgent and expansive:
- **Preserve** the material legacy of Palestinian life
- **Document** the stories embedded in everyday objects
- **Bear witness** to a culture under threat
- **Maintain collective memory** through tangible artifacts
- **Resist erasure** through meticulous record-keeping

## Our Vision: From 100 to 10,000

The number 100 is not our ceiling—it is our foundation. Our vision unfolds in three transformative phases:

### Phase I: The Foundation (100 Objects)
We begin with 100 carefully selected objects that represent the breadth and depth of Palestinian material culture. These first 100 serve as our proof of concept, our template for documentation, and our call to the global Palestinian community and allies to join this vital work.

### Phase II: The Expansion (1,000 Objects)
With our methodology proven and our community established, we expand to document 1,000 objects. This phase represents a comprehensive survey of Palestinian material culture across regions, generations, and social contexts. We move from representation to deep documentation of diversity.

### Phase III: The Archive (10,000 Objects)
Our ultimate goal is the creation of the world's most comprehensive digital archive of Palestinian material culture—10,000 objects that collectively tell the full story of Palestinian life, creativity, and resistance. This archive will serve future generations as an irreplaceable resource for understanding Palestinian identity and experience.

## Our Core Values

### Preservation Above All
Every object we document is an act of preservation. We commit to the highest standards of digital archiving, ensuring that these records will survive and remain accessible for generations to come.

### Community-Driven Documentation
This archive belongs to the Palestinian community first and foremost. We prioritize voices, stories, and perspectives of Palestinians themselves, ensuring authenticity and respect in every entry.

### Witness and Memory
We understand our work as a form of bearing witness. Each documented object is a testament to Palestinian existence, creativity, and resilience. We serve as keepers of collective memory.

### Resistance Through Record-Keeping
Documentation itself is an act of resistance against erasure. By meticulously recording Palestinian material culture, we resist attempts to deny or diminish Palestinian identity and history.

### Radical Accessibility
Our archive must be accessible to all. We commit to open access, multiple languages, and formats that serve diverse communities and uses—from academic research to family heritage projects.

### Excellence and Integrity
Every object deserves our best work. We maintain the highest standards of documentation, research, and presentation, treating each contribution with the respect it deserves.

## Community Principles

### Inclusive Participation
The Pal100 community welcomes Palestinians of all backgrounds, allies, scholars, artists, and anyone committed to our mission. We believe that diverse perspectives strengthen our work.

### Collaborative Knowledge Building
We learn from each other. Community members share expertise, resources, and insights to continuously improve our documentation methods and reach.

### Respectful Representation
We handle every object and story with deep respect, understanding that we are often documenting items of profound personal and cultural significance.

### Transparent Process
Our methodology, decisions, and progress are open to community review and input. We believe transparency builds trust and improves outcomes.

### Mutual Support
Community members support each other's contributions, offering assistance, feedback, and encouragement. We succeed together.

## Governance Framework

### Community Council
A rotating council of community members provides strategic direction, resolves disputes, and ensures our mission remains central to all activities.

### Working Groups
Specialized teams focus on:
- **Technical Infrastructure** - Platform development and maintenance
- **Content Standards** - Documentation guidelines and quality control
- **Community Outreach** - Expanding participation and engagement
- **Academic Relations** - Partnerships with institutions and scholars
- **Digital Preservation** - Long-term archive maintenance and accessibility

### Decision-Making Process
Major decisions are made through community consultation, with transparent processes for gathering input and building consensus.

### Quality Assurance
Community-driven peer review ensures accuracy, cultural sensitivity, and adherence to our documentation standards.

## Our Call to Action

### To the Palestinian Community
Your objects, your stories, your memories matter. Whether you have one item or one hundred, whether you are in Palestine, in diaspora, or anywhere in between—your contribution is vital. Help us build this archive as a gift to future generations.

### To Our Allies
Stand with us in this work of preservation and witness. Contribute your skills, amplify our message, and help us reach Palestinians who may not know about this project but whose stories need to be told.

### To Scholars and Institutions
Partner with us to ensure this archive meets the highest academic standards while remaining community-controlled and accessible. Help us build bridges between grassroots documentation and scholarly research.

### To the Global Community
Recognize the urgency of this moment. Cultural preservation cannot wait for perfect conditions. It must happen now, with the tools and resources we have, driven by community commitment and global solidarity.

## Our Promise

We promise to approach this work with the gravity it deserves. We are not simply collecting objects—we are preserving a people's material legacy at a moment when that preservation is more crucial than ever.

We promise transparency in our methods, respect for our contributors, and unwavering commitment to our mission. We will grow from 100 to 1,000 to 10,000 objects not through compromise of our values, but through their consistent application.

We promise that this archive will serve not only as a record of what was, but as a foundation for what will be—a resource for Palestinian communities to understand their heritage, for scholars to deepen their research, and for the world to recognize the richness and resilience of Palestinian culture.
