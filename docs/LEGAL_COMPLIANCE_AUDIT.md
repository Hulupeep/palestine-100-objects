## JURISDICTIONAL RISK ANALYSIS

### IRISH LAW (Primary Jurisdiction)
- **Defamation Act 2009** requires "fair and accurate reporting" for qualified privilege
- **Public interest defense** (s.26) demands "reasonable checks" - **DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED**
- **Offer to make amends** (s.22) template should be prepared

### UK LAW (Distribution Market)
- **Defamation Act 2013** s.3 - Opinion defense requires stated facts
- **Public interest defense** (s.4) requires "reasonable belief" - **FACT-CHECK LOG NEEDED**
- **Single publication rule** - Critical to get it right the first time

### US LAW (Distribution Market)  
- **Corporate plaintiffs** must prove "actual malice" for defamation
- **State law variations** - No uniform "neutral reportage" protection
- **Opinion protection** limited - factual implications still actionable
