## Introduction: Mapping the Complicity Commons

This index documents the extensive network of corporations, financial institutions, and organizations connected to the infrastructure of occupation and Palestinian resistance documented in *Palestine in 100 Objects*. It represents what we term "the complicity of the commons"—the way millions of ordinary investors worldwide are unknowingly connected to systems that restrict Palestinian freedom through pension funds, index investments, and institutional shareholdings.

**Organization**: Companies are listed alphabetically with key details including stock symbols, primary holdings relationships, and specific connections to objects documented in the book.

**Financial Networks**: Major institutional investors appear across multiple entries, revealing the systematic nature of global financial exposure to occupation infrastructure.

**Verification**: All corporate relationships and financial figures are verified through public filings, established business databases, and cross-referenced sources.

## Conclusion: The Complicity of the Commons

This index documents an extensive network of global corporations and financial institutions connected to Palestinian occupation infrastructure. The investigation reveals what we term "the complicity of the commons"—the way millions of ordinary investors worldwide are unknowingly connected to systems that restrict Palestinian freedom and development.

The same institutional investors—BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street—appear repeatedly as major shareholders in companies manufacturing surveillance technology, demolition equipment, crowd control weapons, and restriction systems. This creates systematic financial exposure for millions of individual investors through pension funds, 401(k) accounts, and index investments.

The total economic scale is enormous: trillions of dollars in managed assets connected to occupation infrastructure through institutional investment. This represents not intentional malice but systematic structural connection—the way modern financial systems create relationships between global capital and local impact that individual investors may never realize.

Understanding these networks enables informed decision-making about investment choices, corporate policies, and financial institution selection. It also reveals opportunities for shareholder advocacy, divestment actions, and alternative investment approaches that align financial decisions with human rights values.

Most importantly, this index demonstrates that Palestinian liberation is not only a political or humanitarian issue—it is also fundamentally an economic and financial question involving some of the world's largest corporations and investment institutions. Creating change requires understanding these systems and working to transform them.
