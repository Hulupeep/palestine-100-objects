# Part III: Objects of Sumud
## Objects 51-75: Palestinian Steadfastness and Cultural Resilience

---

## Introduction: The Art of Remaining

*Sumud* (صمود) - steadfastness - represents more than passive resilience; it is the active art of remaining rooted to the land, preserving cultural identity, and maintaining hope despite systematic oppression. The twenty-five objects documented in Part III demonstrate how everyday items become vessels of cultural memory, tools of resistance, and symbols of unbreakable connection to Palestinian identity.

This section marks a crucial narrative pivot from documenting the instruments of control and destruction to celebrating the objects that embody Palestinian response. These are tools of life affirmation, cultural preservation, and community building that represent Palestinians not as victims but as active agents of their own survival and flourishing.

Each object tells a story of resourcefulness, creativity, and the transformative power of *sumud* - the ability to not merely survive adversity but to transform it into strength, beauty, and connection. From olive saplings that defy systematic tree destruction to embroidery thread that preserves cultural heritage across refugee camps, these objects demonstrate how Palestinians have maintained their identity and dignity despite decades of displacement and restriction.

## Object 51: The Olive Sapling

### The Human Story

The story begins with a family in the West Bank village of al-Walaja, tending to an olive tree known as "Al-Badawi"—the Old One. Estimated to be between 4,000 and 5,000 years old, this ancient tree, a living link to millennia of history, now faces direct threat from Israel's separation wall construction. This single tree's precarious existence encapsulates the dual nature of the olive in Palestine: it is both a sacred symbol of life and a primary target of destruction.

When Israeli forces and settlers destroy olive groves—over 800,000 trees destroyed since 1967—Palestinian families respond by planting new saplings. These young trees represent defiant hope and long-term commitment to the land, embodying the essence of *sumud*. As one Palestinian farmer explained, planting an olive sapling is "a declaration of intent to remain, to rebuild, and to wait for a future harvest."

## Object 52: The Keffiyeh

### The Human Story

In the crowded streets of Shatila refugee camp in Beirut, 78-year-old Um Mahmoud unfolds her late husband's keffiyeh, the black and white checkered headdress he wore for forty-three years. The fabric, worn soft from decades of use, carries scents of olive oil and za'atar from their village near Haifa, destroyed in 1948. "This is not just cloth," she tells her granddaughter Layla. "These patterns tell the story of our land - the fishing nets of our coast, the olive groves of our hills, the trade routes of our ancestors."

What was once practical headwear for Palestinian farmers has become one of the world's most recognizable symbols of resistance, worn from Yasser Arafat's diplomatic missions to student protests in New York to solidarity demonstrations in London.

## Object 53: The Olive Oil Soap

### The Human Story

In the stone basement of her Nablus home, 52-year-old Fatemeh Kanaan stirs olive oil that has been heating for six hours, preparing to make soap using a recipe passed down through fourteen generations. The process, "tabkh al-saboun" (cooking the soap), requires precise timing and ingredients unchanged for centuries: pure olive oil, water, and lye made from barilla ash.

Fatemeh learned from her grandmother, who continued making soap during the 2002 Israeli siege of Nablus when residents were trapped for months. "When we had no electricity, no water, no bread, we still had soap. We had something clean, something pure, something ours." Each bar is stamped "Made in Palestine"—an act of cultural assertion in a context where Palestinian products are often given no geographic identifier.

## Object 54: The Dabke Dance Shoe

### The Human Story

Every Thursday evening in Dearborn, Michigan, 16-year-old Layla Saleh laces up traditional dabke shoes—soft leather slippers allowing her feet to feel every vibration of Palestinian folk dance. Born in Detroit to refugee parents, Layla has never seen Palestine, but when she dances dabke, she feels connected to a homeland she knows only through stories. The shoes, handmade by her grandfather in Aida refugee camp, carry the weight of four generations of displacement.

"When I put on these shoes, I'm walking in my great-grandmother's footsteps, keeping alive the movements she taught before the Nakba." Through repetitive stomping movements—dabke literally means "stamping"—Palestinian youth assert their presence and unbreakable connection to Palestine.

## Object 55: The Arabic Coffee Pot (Dal'lah)

### The Human Story

In her small apartment in Balata refugee camp, 68-year-old Umm Ahmad measures green coffee beans into her brass dal'lah, the traditional coffee pot serving her family for three generations. The pot was one of few possessions her mother carried when fleeing their village near Jaffa in 1948. "Coffee is not just a drink for us. It is how we say 'you are welcome here,' how we show respect, how we maintain our dignity even in hardest times."

The stone fits perfectly in his palm as he prepares to join the weekly Friday protest against the separation wall cutting through his family's olive grove. This stone came from the foundation of his great-grandfather's house, demolished in 1967, fragments scattered across the hillside where Palestinian children have collected them for generations.

"This stone knows our land," his father explained. "When you throw it, you're throwing our history, our connection to this soil, our refusal to be erased."

Her grandmother carried it when fleeing Haifa in 1948, her mother clutched it during the Six-Day War exodus, and now Leila holds it as sirens wail outside her window in 2024.

The margins are filled with handwritten notes in Arabic, a family tradition of adding personal verses to the master's work. Leila's grandmother wrote of orange groves left behind, her mother of children growing up behind barbed wire, and Leila herself has begun adding lines about dreams deferred but never abandoned. Each annotation is a small act of literary resistance, transforming the printed word into living testimony.

The book represents more than literature; it embodies the Palestinian commitment to preserving identity through words when land has been taken. In refugee camps across the Middle East, similar books circulate like underground currency. They're photocopied, shared, memorized, and recited at weddings and funerals alike.

## Object 67: The Dabke Drum

### The Human Story

The rhythm echoes through the narrow alleyways of Balata refugee camp as Abu Ahmad strikes the derbakeh with practiced hands. His weathered fingers, stained with years of drummaking, know exactly where to hit the stretched goatskin to produce the deep, resonating beat that calls the community to dance. Tonight, like every Friday for the past thirty years, the elders will teach the children dabke, the traditional folk dance that connects Palestinians to their village roots.

Abu Ahmad learned drum-making from his father, who learned from his grandfather in their original village of Zakariya, now erased from maps but alive in memory and rhythm.

The seeds—from Palestinian heirloom tomatoes, ancient wheat varieties, and native herbs—represent seven decades of careful preservation, passed from mother to daughter along with whispered instructions about planting times, soil preparation, and harvest rituals.

Each spring, despite living in an urban apartment with only a small balcony, Umm Khalil plants a few of these precious seeds in whatever containers she can find.

### The Politics of Cultural Survival

Part III documents how Palestinian cultural preservation represents political action. In a context where Palestinian existence itself is contested, maintaining cultural traditions becomes an act of resistance. The objects of *sumud* assert Palestinian presence, preserve Palestinian history, and create foundations for Palestinian futures.

These objects demonstrate that Palestinians are not merely victims of systematic oppression but active agents creating alternatives, preserving heritage, and building community resilience. They represent the transformative power of *sumud*—the ability to not merely survive adversity but to transform it into strength, beauty, and hope.

The infrastructure of steadfastness revealed through these objects provides the foundation for Palestinian survival and the groundwork for Palestinian liberation. They demonstrate that even under the most restrictive conditions, human creativity, cultural preservation, and community solidarity create spaces of freedom and dignity.

Most importantly, these objects reveal that Palestinian resistance takes many forms—not only the stones thrown at military vehicles documented in resistance imagery, but also the threads that preserve cultural memory, the saplings that assert connection to land, and the coffee pots that maintain traditions of hospitality and human dignity.
