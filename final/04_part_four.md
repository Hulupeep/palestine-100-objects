# Part IV: Tools of a New Generation
## Objects 76-100: Palestinian Innovation and Future-Building

---

## Introduction: Technology as Liberation

The final section of *Palestine in 100 Objects* shifts from documenting the tools of oppression and survival to celebrating the instruments of innovation and future-building. These twenty-five objects represent a generation of Palestinians who refuse to be defined by their circumstances, instead leveraging technology to circumvent restrictions, build economic independence, and create new possibilities for their communities.

Unlike the objects of destruction analyzed in Part I, or even the tools of steadfastness (*sumud*) documented in Part III, these innovations represent active transformation—the conversion of barriers into bridges, restrictions into opportunities, and isolation into connection. They embody what Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish called "the will to live," manifested through engineering, entrepreneurship, and the audacious belief that technology can create freedom.

Each object tells a story of resourcefulness in the face of impossible odds. From solar batteries that break energy dependence to 3D printers that manufacture medical devices under siege, these tools represent a quiet revolution—one powered not by ideology but by ingenuity, not by resistance to the present but by commitment to a different future.

This is Palestinian innovation as *sumud* for the digital age: technology that bends with constraints but remains rooted in community values, environmental sustainability, and social solidarity. These objects map a vision of Palestinian technological sovereignty that goes beyond simple access to existing technologies—they represent Palestinian participation in shaping technological futures on their own terms.

## Object 76: The Solar Battery - Engineering Energy Independence

### The Human Story

In the sun-drenched landscape of Palestine, where 320 days of annual sunshine rank the territories among the world's top solar energy locations, 34-year-old electrical engineer Amjad Saeed climbs onto his family's rooftop in Hebron to check the battery bank that has transformed their relationship with electricity. The lithium-ion batteries, charged by solar panels installed through a university extension program, store enough energy to power his home for three days without sun.

Amjad works at Palestine Polytechnic University (PPU), which converted itself into a model for solar energy independence with just $137,000 in USAID funding. The university's photovoltaic system now generates 400,000 kWh annually, meeting 60% of institutional energy needs while saving $78,000 per year—money reinvested in expanding both educational programs and solar capacity.

"Every kilowatt we generate ourselves is one kilowatt of independence," Amjad explains, watching his battery indicator show 87% charge at sunset. His family, like thousands of Palestinians adopting solar battery systems, has discovered that energy independence is not just about cost savings—it's about freedom from the systematic control of basic necessities.

## Object 77: The 3D Printer - Manufacturing Independence Under Siege

### The Human Story

Muhammad Abu Matar never intended to become Gaza's pioneer of 3D printing—the technology found him out of necessity. When Israeli blockade restrictions classified 3D printers as "dual-use" technology banned from entering Gaza, Abu Matar had no choice but to build his own from spare parts and open-source designs found online. Starting with $5,000 in prize money and a $20,000 loan, he founded Tashkeel3D in 2016.

The breakthrough came through partnership with Dr. Tarek Loubani, a Palestinian-Canadian emergency physician who founded the Glia Project to develop open-source medical devices. Together, they began 3D-printing stethoscopes costing $3 compared to $200 commercial alternatives, tourniquets to prevent hemorrhaging, and otoscopes for medical examinations.

When plastic filament couldn't be imported, Abu Matar built his own plastic-thread machine. When his facility was destroyed in a May 2021 airstrike causing $150,000 in damages, he rebuilt. For Abu Matar, 3D printing represents more than manufacturing—it's digital resistance to physical blockade.

"We don't just print objects," he explains, holding a locally produced stethoscope. "We print possibilities."

Vivien Sansour's Palestinian Heirloom Seed Library began with a profound understanding: to control a people's food, you must first control their seeds. The agronomist from Beit Jala established the seed library in the West Bank village of Battir, known for ancient agricultural terraces representing thousands of years of Palestinian farming wisdom.

Do'a Zayed, the PhD agronomist who headed the Union of Agricultural Work Committees (UAWC) seed bank in Hebron, articulated the political significance of seed preservation: "To have your independent voice and independent thinking you have to have food sovereignty, and that starts with control over your own seeds."

The UAWC facility served as Palestine's only national seed bank, safeguarding over 70 varieties of indigenous heirloom seeds, many existing nowhere else in Palestine. In October 2024, the facility made history by submitting 23 Palestinian seed varieties to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway, ensuring international preservation of Palestinian agricultural heritage.

### Vision for Palestinian Technological Sovereignty

These objects map a vision of Palestinian technological sovereignty that transcends simple access to existing technologies. They represent Palestinian participation in shaping technological futures—creating systems that serve Palestinian needs and reflect Palestinian values of community resilience, environmental sustainability, and social solidarity.

The solar battery transforms sunshine into freedom. The 3D printer converts digital files into physical necessity. The cryptocurrency wallet creates parallel economies. The seed bank preserves agricultural heritage. The innovation center nurtures technological futures.

Together, these objects embody Palestinian refusal to accept technological dependence or digital subordination. They represent active choices to build rather than merely resist, to create alternatives rather than simply demand access to existing systems.

### The Persistence of Innovation

The destruction of the UAWC seed bank and the death of Mai Ubeid remind us that technological innovation under occupation operates under existential threat. Yet the persistence of Palestinian innovation despite these losses demonstrates the deep roots of technological *sumud*—the understanding that creating alternatives is itself resistance, and that the future must be built with today's available tools.

These objects represent hope grounded in practical action, vision anchored in technical capability, and resistance expressed through creation rather than destruction. They embody Palestinian commitment not just to surviving the present, but to engineering a different future—one solar panel, one 3D printed part, one encrypted message, one preserved seed at a time.

The Palestinian innovation story is ultimately about transformation: converting barriers into bridges, restrictions into opportunities, and isolation into global connection. These hundred objects—from tear gas canisters to innovation centers—tell the complete story of Palestinian experience in the modern world, revealing both the machinery of oppression and the boundless creativity of human response.

Most importantly, they demonstrate that Palestinians are not merely objects of historical forces but active agents creating their own technological futures. In a world increasingly defined by digital technologies and innovation economies, Palestinian contributions to global innovation represent not just survival but leadership—showing how constraint can catalyze creativity, how limitation can inspire liberation, and how the most restricted communities can become the most innovative.

The final lesson of these hundred objects is that the future belongs not to those who control the most resources, but to those who demonstrate the greatest creativity in transforming available resources into tools of liberation. In this fundamental capacity for innovation under constraint, Palestine offers the world a profound lesson in technological *sumud*—the art of remaining rooted while reaching toward the future.
