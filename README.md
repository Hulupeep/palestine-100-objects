# Pal100: Palestine in 100+ Objects
### A Community-Driven Documentation Project

## üåç About the Pal100 Community Initiative

**This project is brought to you by the Pal100 community whose objective is to chronicle and distribute the Palestinian experience through materal culture. It includes the tracing of objects through the flow of money.**

These are the objects that Palestinans encounter every day. A medical glove, a bulldozer (who profits), a phone (where data is stored), a key that has been passed down through generations. 

The **Pal100 community** is an **urgent, community-driven preservation project** documenting Palestinian material culture and the money that powers it through systematic object documentation. Starting with 100 foundational objects, we are scaling to create the world's most comprehensive online archive of Palestinian material culture and sources - growing to 1,000 then 10,000 objects through community participation worldwide.

**‚è∞ URGENT**: We recognize the critical importance of preserving what may not survive the current situation. Every object documented, every story preserved, every connection traced becomes part of a permanent historical record for future generations.

**Repository**: [https://github.com/Hulupeep/palestine-100-objects](https://github.com/Hulupeep/palestine-100-objects)

**ü§ù This is an open, community-driven research project actively seeking contributors, fact-checkers, and subject matter experts. Your input is crucial to improving accuracy and completeness.**

## üöÄ Our Scaling Vision: 100 ‚Üí 1,000 ‚Üí 10,000

The Pal100 community operates on an ambitious scaling framework:

### üìä **Phase 1: The Foundation (100 Objects)**
- **Current Status**: 100 objects documented across 4 thematic sections
- **Purpose**: Establish methodology, build community, prove concept
- **Timeline**: 2024-2025

### üìà **Phase 2: The Expansion (1,000 Objects)**
- **Vision**: 10x growth through community contributions
- **Focus**: Regional variations, historical depth, contemporary developments
- **Community Goal**: Mobilize global Palestinian diaspora and allies

### üåü **Phase 3: The Archive (10,000 Objects)**
- **Vision**: Comprehensive material culture documentation
- **Scope**: Every aspect of Palestinian life, past and present
- **Legacy**: Permanent digital and physical archives for future generations

**Every object matters. Every story counts. Every contribution builds toward 10,000.**

## üî¨ Community Research Approach

The Pal100 community collaboratively works to:
- Trace objects from their point of use/impact back through supply chains
- Document corporate and financial networks where possible
- Collect personal stories and testimonies from community members
- Verify claims through multiple independent sources
- Balance documentation of control systems with stories of resilience and sumud
- Preserve material culture that may be at risk of disappearing

**Note**: This is ongoing research. Many claims need additional verification, some sections are incomplete, and we expect corrections and updates as more information becomes available.

## üìñ Current Structure (Draft)

### Part I: Architecture of Control (Objects 1-25)
*Community documentation* of infrastructure and systems of control - bulldozers, surveillance systems, checkpoints. **Community Needs: Technical specifications, corporate documentation, witness accounts**

### Part II: Weaponization of the Everyday (Objects 26-50)
*Community investigation* of how civilian objects become instruments of restriction. **Community Needs: Supply chain verification, policy documentation, impact studies**

### Part III: Objects of Sumud (Objects 51-75)
*Community preservation* of Palestinian steadfastness through cultural objects and traditions. **Community Needs: Cultural experts, historical context, personal narratives**

### Part IV: Tools of New Generation (Objects 76-100)
*Community exploration* of Palestinian innovation and creative resistance. **Community Needs: Tech specifications, startup data, youth perspectives**

### Part V: Community Expansion (Objects 101+)
*Your contributions shape the future* - personal objects, regional variations, historical artifacts, contemporary innovations. **This is where the community takes the lead toward 1,000 and 10,000 objects.**

## üìä Current Community Status

### Phase 1 Progress (100 Objects):
- **Objects Documented**: 100 (in various stages of completion)
- **Community Contributors**: Growing daily
- **Word Count**: ~120,000 (expanding with community input)
- **Sources Collected**: 2,000+ (community verification ongoing)
- **Verification Rate**: Approximately 89% (improving through community review)
- **Community Gaps Identified**: Multiple areas need community expertise

### Scaling Metrics:
- **Path to 1,000**: Every community contribution gets us closer
- **Path to 10,000**: Building the infrastructure for permanent archive
- **Urgency Factor**: Preserving what may be lost - time is critical

## üöß Known Limitations

- **Incomplete Verification**: Not all sources have been fully verified
- **Evolving Information**: Financial data, corporate structures change rapidly
- **Access Limitations**: Some information difficult to obtain or verify
- **Translation Needs**: Many Arabic sources need translation
- **Legal Review**: Pending comprehensive legal review for publication
