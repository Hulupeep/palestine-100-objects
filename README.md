# Palestine in 100 Objects: A Collaborative Research Project

## 📚 About This Initiative

An ongoing investigative research project attempting to document the Palestinian experience through material culture. We're examining 100 objects - from everyday items to complex systems - tracing their stories, supply chains, and human impact. This is a work in progress, and we need your help to verify, expand, and improve this documentation.

**Repository**: [https://github.com/Hulupeep/palestine-100-objects](https://github.com/Hulupeep/palestine-100-objects)

**🤝 This is an open research project actively seeking contributors, fact-checkers, and subject matter experts. Your input is crucial to improving accuracy and completeness.**

## 🔬 Research Approach

We're attempting to:
- Trace objects from their point of use/impact back through supply chains
- Document corporate and financial networks where possible
- Collect personal stories and testimonies
- Verify claims through multiple independent sources
- Balance documentation of control systems with stories of resilience

**Note**: This is ongoing research. Many claims need additional verification, some sections are incomplete, and we expect corrections and updates as more information becomes available.

## 📖 Current Structure (Draft)

### Part I: Architecture of Control (Objects 1-25)
*Attempting to document* infrastructure and systems of control - bulldozers, surveillance systems, checkpoints. **Needs: Technical specifications, corporate documentation, witness accounts**

### Part II: Weaponization of the Everyday (Objects 26-50)
*Investigating* how civilian objects become instruments of restriction. **Needs: Supply chain verification, policy documentation, impact studies**

### Part III: Objects of Sumud (Objects 51-75)
*Collecting stories of* Palestinian steadfastness through cultural objects and traditions. **Needs: Cultural experts, historical context, personal narratives**

### Part IV: Tools of New Generation (Objects 76-100)
*Exploring* Palestinian innovation and creative resistance. **Needs: Tech specifications, startup data, youth perspectives**

## 📊 Current Status

- **Objects Drafted**: 100 (in various stages of completion)
- **Word Count**: ~120,000 (subject to change)
- **Sources Collected**: 2,000+ (many need verification)
- **Verification Rate**: Approximately 89% (ongoing process)
- **Gaps Identified**: Multiple areas need additional research

## 🚧 Known Limitations

- **Incomplete Verification**: Not all sources have been fully verified
- **Evolving Information**: Financial data, corporate structures change rapidly
- **Access Limitations**: Some information difficult to obtain or verify
- **Translation Needs**: Many Arabic sources need translation
- **Legal Review**: Pending comprehensive legal review for publication

## 🆘 Where We Need Help

### Urgent Needs:
1. **Arabic Speakers**: Translate and verify Arabic sources
2. **Financial Analysts**: Verify investment data and corporate structures
3. **Engineers/Technical Experts**: Confirm equipment specifications
4. **Historians**: Provide context and verify historical claims
5. **On-Ground Reporters**: Current information from Palestine
6. **Legal Experts**: Review for defamation risks and accuracy

### Specific Research Gaps:
- Supply chain documentation for Objects 15-25
- Personal testimonies for Objects 40-50
- Technical specifications for surveillance equipment
- Current financial data (post-2024)
- Historical context for cultural objects
