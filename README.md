Palestine in 100 Objects: A Collaborative Research Project
📚 About This Initiative
An ongoing investigative research project attempting to document the Palestinian experience through material culture. We're examining 100 objects - from everyday items to complex systems - tracing their stories, supply chains, and human impact. This is a work in progress, and we need your help to verify, expand, and improve this documentation.

Repository: https://github.com/Hulupeep/palestine-100-objects

🤝 This is an open research project actively seeking contributors, fact-checkers, and subject matter experts. Your input is crucial to improving accuracy and completeness.

🔬 Research Approach
We're attempting to:

Trace objects from their point of use/impact back through supply chains
Document corporate and financial networks where possible
Collect personal stories and testimonies
Verify claims through multiple independent sources
Balance documentation of control systems with stories of resilience
Note: This is ongoing research. Many claims need additional verification, some sections are incomplete, and we expect corrections and updates as more information becomes available.

📖 Current Structure (Draft)
Part I: Architecture of Control (Objects 1-25)
Attempting to document infrastructure and systems of control - bulldozers, surveillance systems, checkpoints. Needs: Technical specifications, corporate documentation, witness accounts

Part II: Weaponization of the Everyday (Objects 26-50)
Investigating how civilian objects become instruments of restriction. Needs: Supply chain verification, policy documentation, impact studies

Part III: Objects of Sumud (Objects 51-75)
Collecting stories of Palestinian steadfastness through cultural objects and traditions. Needs: Cultural experts, historical context, personal narratives

Part IV: Tools of New Generation (Objects 76-100)
Exploring Palestinian innovation and creative resistance. Needs: Tech specifications, startup data, youth perspectives
