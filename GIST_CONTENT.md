# Pal100 Community: Palestine in 100+ Objects
### A Community-Driven Preservation Initiative - Scaling from 100 ‚Üí 1,000 ‚Üí 10,000 Objects

**This project is brought to you by the Pal100 community whose objective is to chronicle and distribute the Palestinian experience through material culture.**

An urgent, community-driven initiative to preserve Palestinian material culture through systematic documentation. Starting with 100 foundational objects, the **Pal100 community** is scaling to create the world's most comprehensive archive of Palestinian material culture - growing to 1,000 then 10,000 objects.

**‚è∞ URGENT**: We recognize the critical importance of preserving what may not survive the current situation. Every object documented, every story preserved becomes part of a permanent historical record for future generations.

## üåç Pal100 Community Vision

**"This is not a finished book but an invitation to collective documentation by the Palestinian community and its allies. Every correction makes it stronger, every contribution more complete, every object documented brings us closer to 10,000."**

The **Pal100 community** is building a living, expanding archive that:
- **Scales from 100 to 10,000 objects** through community participation
- **Centers Palestinian voices** in documenting their own material culture  
- **Preserves what may be lost** with urgency and care
- **Builds global understanding** through authentic, community-told stories
- **Creates permanent historical record** for future generations

**Every object matters. Every story counts. Every contribution builds toward 10,000.**

*"If the Pal100 Community archive has a beginning, it must be here‚Äîwith the key that still rattles in pockets and drawers, waiting for a door that no longer exists, insisting on a truth that no demolition can erase. But it does not end with one key, or even one hundred objects. It expands with every Palestinian who shares their story, until 10,000 objects tell the full story of our material culture."*
