## Object 66: The Poetry Book

### The Human Story

In the dim light of her Gaza apartment, Leila al-Zahra carefully turns the yellowed pages of a poetry collection, its spine held together with electrical tape. The book, "Songs of Return" by Mahmoud Darwish, has traveled with her family through three generations of displacement. Her grandmother carried it when fleeing Haifa in 1948, her mother clutched it during the Six-Day War exodus, and now Leila holds it as sirens wail outside her window in 2024.

The margins are filled with handwritten notes in Arabic, a family tradition of adding personal verses to the master's work. Leila's grandmother wrote of orange groves left behind, her mother of children growing up behind barbed wire, and Leila herself has begun adding lines about dreams deferred but never abandoned. Each annotation is a small act of literary resistance, transforming the printed word into living testimony.

The book represents more than literature; it embodies the Palestinian commitment to preserving identity through words when land has been taken. In refugee camps across the Middle East, similar books circulate like underground currency. They're photocopied, shared, memorized, and recited at weddings and funerals alike. Israeli authorities have, at various times, censored Palestinian poets, banned books, and raided cultural centers, making the simple act of owning Palestinian poetry a form of quiet rebellion.

Leila teaches Arabic literature at a UNRWA school, where resources are scarce but the hunger for cultural knowledge remains strong. She uses her grandmother's annotated Darwish collection as a teaching tool, showing students how poetry becomes a vessel for collective memory. "When they try to erase our history," she tells her students, "we write it again in verse."

The poetry book serves as a time capsule, preserving not just artistic expression but the emotional landscape of a people. It captures the longing for return (awda), the steadfastness in place (sumud), and the dream of liberation that connects Palestinians across the diaspora. Each reading is an act of cultural resurrection, breathing life into experiences that might otherwise be forgotten.

During the 2014 Gaza war, when Leila's building shook from nearby explosions, she wrapped the poetry book in plastic and kept it close. "If I die," she told her daughter, "save the book. The poems will outlive us all." This sentiment echoes across Palestinian communities worldwide, where literary preservation is seen as essential to cultural survival. The poetry book becomes a portable homeland, carrying the essence of Palestine wherever Palestinians go.

### The Object

**Design & Significance**: The poetry book, often weathered and well-worn, represents the preservation of Palestinian literary heritage. These books, whether original publications or hand-copied manuscripts, serve as repositories of cultural memory and identity. The physical wear patterns tell stories of frequent use, family sharing, and survival through conflict.

**Cultural Role**: In Palestinian culture, poetry holds sacred status as the preserver of oral tradition, historical memory, and collective identity. These books often contain works by renowned Palestinian poets like Mahmoud Darwish, Samih al-Qasim, and Fadwa Tuqan, whose verses have become anthems of resistance and longing.

**Symbolic Power**: Beyond literature, poetry books represent intellectual resistance against cultural erasure. They demonstrate the Palestinian commitment to preserving language, memory, and identity despite displacement and oppression.

### The Supply Chain

## Object 67: The Dabke Drum

### The Human Story

The rhythm echoes through the narrow alleyways of Balata refugee camp as Abu Ahmad strikes the derbakeh with practiced hands. His weathered fingers, stained with years of drummaking, know exactly where to hit the stretched goatskin to produce the deep, resonating beat that calls the community to dance. Tonight, like every Friday for the past thirty years, the elders will teach the children dabke, the traditional folk dance that connects Palestinians to their village roots.

Abu Ahmad learned drum-making from his father, who learned from his grandfather in their original village of Zakariya, now erased from maps but alive in memory and rhythm. The drum in his hands was crafted in the traditional way: a clay body shaped from earth that his great-grandfather claimed was mixed with soil from their ancestral lands. Whether true or metaphorical, the belief infuses each beat with the power of place.

The dabke drum serves as more than a musical instrument; it's a cultural lifeline. In the confines of the refugee camp, where concrete walls replace open fields and unemployment rates soar above 40%, the Friday night dabke sessions provide connection to a heritage that transcends physical displacement. Children who have never seen an olive grove learn the movements that simulate harvesting. Youth who know only city streets practice the steps their grandparents danced on village threshing floors.

During the First Intifada, Israeli soldiers banned community gatherings, viewing even cultural events as potential security threats. Abu Ahmad hid his drums, but the rhythms lived on in whispered songs and secret gatherings. The drum became a symbol of cultural resistance, its beat representing the heartbeat of a people refusing to disappear. When soldiers searched the camp, they sometimes confiscated drums along with other "suspicious" items, not understanding they were seizing pieces of Palestinian soul.

The tradition of dabke dancing creates intergenerational bonds that might otherwise fray under the pressures of displacement and modernization. Grandfathers who rarely speak of their trauma find voice in the dance steps that tell stories of harvest, wedding, and celebration. Teenagers, caught between Palestinian identity and global culture, discover pride in mastering the complex formations that require teamwork, timing, and trust.

Abu Ahmad's grandson, Marwan, initially showed little interest in the old traditions, preferring his smartphone to his grandfather's stories. But when Marwan was twelve, he joined the dabke line for the first time, feeling the power of synchronized movement and shared rhythm. Now seventeen, he helps his grandfather teach younger children, ensuring the tradition survives another generation. "The drum speaks when words fail," Marwan explains, unconsciously echoing his grandfather's wisdom.

### The Object

## Object 68: The Heirloom Seeds

### The Human Story

In a small glass jar hidden behind canned goods in her Bethlehem kitchen, Umm Khalil keeps seeds that her great-grandmother smuggled from their village in 1948. The seeds—from Palestinian heirloom tomatoes, ancient wheat varieties, and native herbs—represent seven decades of careful preservation, passed from mother to daughter along with whispered instructions about planting times, soil preparation, and harvest rituals.

Each spring, despite living in an urban apartment with only a small balcony, Umm Khalil plants a few of these precious seeds in whatever containers she can find. The resulting plants may seem modest—a single tomato plant in a plastic bucket, herbs growing in yogurt containers—but they carry the genetic memory of Palestinian agriculture dating back millennia. These are not hybrid varieties developed for shipping or shelf life, but seeds that evolved with the Palestinian landscape, adapted to local rainfall patterns, soil conditions, and traditional farming methods.

The practice of seed saving connects Umm Khalil to an unbroken chain of Palestinian women who understood that preserving seeds meant preserving culture itself. Her great-grandmother spoke of tomatoes so flavorful they were eaten like apples, of wheat that could survive drought years, and of herbs with healing properties known only through generations of folk knowledge. When the family was forced to leave their village, these seeds represented portable homeland—the biological essence of their land carried in the folds of a dress.

During the current restrictions on Palestinian agricultural development, these heirloom varieties have taken on new significance. Israeli agricultural policies have introduced genetically modified seeds and industrial farming methods that gradually replace traditional varieties. Palestinian farmers increasingly depend on seed companies for annual purchases rather than saving seeds from their own harvests—a practice that both increases costs and breaks cultural continuity.

Umm Khalil's daughter initially showed little interest in the "old ways," preferring to buy vegetables from the supermarket rather than nurture plants on their cramped balcony. But when her own daughter was born, something shifted. Watching her granddaughter taste a sun-warmed tomato grown from great-great-grandmother's seeds, seeing the child's eyes widen at flavors unavailable in any store, the young mother understood she was witnessing genetic and cultural inheritance simultaneously.

The seeds represent resistance against agricultural colonization, the process by which traditional farming knowledge and genetic diversity are replaced by industrial monocultures. Each saved seed is an act of biological sovereignty, maintaining Palestinian agricultural heritage against pressures toward uniformity and dependence. In community gardens across the diaspora, Palestinians plant these heritage varieties, creating small patches of ancestral landscape wherever they settle.

## Object 69: The Stone Carving Tools

### The Human Story

In his workshop carved from the hillside in Beit Sahour, master stone carver Khalil Tadros runs his weathered fingers across tools that have shaped Palestinian limestone for three generations. His grandfather's chisels, now worn smooth from decades of use, still hold their edge with the precision that only comes from handforged carbon steel. These tools—chisels of various angles, mallets weighted for different strikes, and rasps filed by hand—represent an unbroken tradition of Palestinian stonework that predates recorded history.

The walls of Khalil's workshop display the evolution of his craft: geometric patterns inspired by Islamic art, Christian religious scenes for local churches, and secular designs that celebrate Palestinian landscapes. Each piece begins with local limestone, the same golden stone that built the Dome of the Rock, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and countless Palestinian villages whose names were erased from maps but whose stone foundations still mark the landscape.

Khalil learned his craft as a child, watching his father transform rough blocks into architectural elements for homes, schools, and places of worship. The knowledge passed through hands and eyes rather than books—how to read the grain of the stone, where to place the first cut, how to coax details from resistant material. Each tool in his collection has a specific purpose, developed through centuries of innovation by Palestinian artisans who understood stone as a living material.

The tradition faces existential challenges in the modern era. Israeli restrictions on Palestinian construction limit demand for traditional stonework, while machine-cut alternatives undercut handcrafted products. Young Palestinians, facing unemployment rates exceeding 30%, often migrate to find work rather than apprentice in traditional crafts. The knowledge risks disappearing with the generation that still remembers when every Palestinian village had its master stone carvers.

Yet Khalil persists, not just as craftsman but as cultural guardian. He accepts apprentices without payment, understanding that preserving the craft preserves something essential about Palestinian identity. The stone carving tradition connects Palestinians to their landscape in ways that transcend political boundaries—the same limestone that forms the bedrock of Palestinian villages also shapes the identity of those who work it into art.

His current project, a relief depicting olive trees and Palestinian village architecture, will travel to a Palestinian cultural center in Detroit, where diaspora community members commissioned it as a centerpiece for their new meeting hall. Through stone and tools passed down through generations, Palestinian culture travels across continents, maintaining connections between homeland and diaspora that no political force can sever.

## Object 70: The Arabic Calligraphy Pen

### The Human Story

Master calligrapher Ibrahim Ghannam carefully cuts a reed pen (qalam) from bamboo grown in his small garden behind his home in Ramallah. His hands, stained with decades of ink, shape the tip with the same precision his teacher demonstrated forty years ago in Damascus, when Palestinian students could still travel freely to centers of Arabic learning. The pen, seemingly simple in design, requires extraordinary skill to create—each cut determines how the ink flows, how letters form, and how sacred verses take shape on parchment.

Ibrahim learned the traditional art of Arabic calligraphy as cultural practice, not mere decoration. In Palestinian culture, beautiful handwriting represents spiritual discipline, cultural sophistication, and connection to the Arabic language that carries Islamic and Christian traditions alike. His workshop walls display verses from the Quran rendered in various scripts, Christian prayers in flowing naskh style, and secular poetry celebrating Palestinian landscapes in elegant thuluth.

The reed pen connects Ibrahim to an unbroken tradition stretching back to the earliest Arabic manuscripts. Unlike modern fountain pens or markers, the qalam requires the calligrapher to mix ink, maintain proper pen angle, and breathe rhythm into each stroke. The tool demands patience and presence that reflects the meditative aspects of traditional calligraphy, where creating beautiful letters becomes spiritual practice.

Under occupation restrictions, Palestinian cultural activities face constant scrutiny. Ibrahim's calligraphy classes sometimes draw suspicion, as Arabic writing itself becomes politicized. Students report being stopped at checkpoints and questioned about Arabic texts in their possession, even when the content consists of poetry or religious verses. The simple act of teaching beautiful Arabic writing becomes an assertion of cultural rights in an environment that often treats Palestinian cultural expression as potential threat.

Despite these challenges, Ibrahim maintains a waiting list of students eager to learn traditional calligraphy. Children who primarily encounter Arabic through social media discover the meditative power of forming letters by hand. Adults find stress relief in the repetitive motions of practice exercises. Religious communities commission Ibrahim to create traditional decorative texts for mosques and churches, maintaining aesthetic traditions that unite Palestinian Muslims and Christians in shared appreciation for Arabic script beauty.

The reed pen also travels internationally, as Ibrahim sends hand-cut qalams to Palestinian calligraphers worldwide. In Chicago, a Palestinian-American doctor practices calligraphy as evening meditation, using pens sent from Ibrahim's workshop to maintain connections with traditional practices. In London, a Palestinian refugee teaches weekend calligraphy classes at a community center, sharing techniques learned through online lessons with Ibrahim, the reed pens serving as tangible links between diaspora communities and homeland traditions.

## Object 71: The Traditional Coffee Pot

### The Human Story

The dallah sits at the center of Abu Mahmoud's living room in Jenin refugee camp, its burnished brass surface reflecting the afternoon light that streams through small windows. This traditional Arabic coffee pot, inherited from his grandfather who fled their village in 1948, represents more than sixty years of Palestinian hospitality preserved in displacement. Every morning, Abu Mahmoud performs the ritual his grandfather taught him: grinding green coffee beans with cardamom, boiling water in the long-spouted pot, and preparing the first cup that must be offered to any guest who enters their home.

The dallah embodies Palestinian concepts of generosity and honor that transcend economic circumstances. Despite living in a small refugee camp apartment with limited income, Abu Mahmoud never fails to offer coffee to visitors, whether friends, neighbors, or strangers seeking directions. The coffee pot transforms any gathering into a social event, its presence signaling that hospitality rituals will be observed regardless of political circumstances or material constraints.

Palestinian coffee culture differs from commercial coffee shop experiences increasingly common worldwide. The traditional preparation is slow, meditative, and communal. Abu Mahmoud explains each step to his grandson Omar: how to roast the beans until they release their oils, how to grind them with just enough cardamom to enhance without overwhelming, how to pour from height to create the foam that indicates proper preparation. These are not just cooking techniques but cultural transmissions that connect Omar to Palestinian identity through sensory experience.

The coffee pot also serves diplomatic functions in Palestinian social organization. When disputes arise between families or neighbors, the ritual of coffee sharing provides a framework for resolution. Accepting coffee indicates willingness to negotiate, while refusing coffee signals serious offense. The eldest woman typically controls coffee preparation and service, wielding significant social power through her management of these hospitality protocols.

During the Second Intifada, when curfews trapped families in their homes for days, the coffee pot provided psychological comfort and maintained normal routines under abnormal circumstances. Abu Mahmoud recalls gathering his extended family around the dallah during bombardments, the familiar ritual providing stability when everything else seemed uncertain. The coffee pot became a anchor of normalcy, its presence insisting on civilian life and cultural continuity despite military pressure.

Today, Omar initially showed more interest in espresso machines and international coffee chains than his grandfather's traditional methods. But when Omar married and established his own household, his grandfather presented him with a small dallah as a wedding gift. Teaching his own wife the proper coffee preparation techniques, Omar discovered pride in maintaining traditions that connect him to Palestinian identity while establishing his role as household head responsible for extending hospitality to guests.

## Object 72: The Folk Tale Recording

### The Human Story

On an old cassette tape wrapped in fading plastic, the voice of Sitt Fatima al-Qasemi tells the story of Handala and the Magic Olive Tree to her grandson Youssef in their home in Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp, Lebanon, in 1987. Her weathered voice, thick with the accent of her lost village near Haifa, weaves tales that her own grandmother told her seventy years ago, stories that carry the geography and values of Palestinian village life into exile.

The recording was made by Youssef's father, who recognized that his mother's storytelling represented an irreplaceable cultural archive. Sitt Fatima knew dozens of traditional tales, each containing moral lessons, geographical references to Palestinian landscapes, and cultural knowledge about everything from agricultural practices to conflict resolution. These stories, passed orally through generations of Palestinian women, provided entertainment, education, and cultural transmission long before television or internet.

The tale of Handala—not the political cartoon character, but the traditional Palestinian folk hero—includes detailed descriptions of olive groves, village social structures, and seasonal celebrations that children in refugee camps had never experienced firsthand. Through Sitt Fatima's storytelling, Lebanese-born Palestinian children learned about their grandparents' villages, understanding their cultural heritage through narrative rather than direct experience.

When Sitt Fatima passed away in 1992, the cassette tape became precious family heritage. Youssef, now grown with children of his own, has digitized the recording and shares it with Palestinian communities worldwide through social media. The stories have reached Palestinian families in Detroit, Sydney, and London, connecting diaspora children to traditional narratives that might otherwise be lost.

The recording also serves documentary purposes for researchers studying Palestinian oral traditions. Sitt Fatima's version of familiar stories contains unique elements specific to her village and family, variations that demonstrate how oral traditions adapt while maintaining core cultural values. Her storytelling techniques—the use of repetitive phrases, interactive elements that engage listeners, and moral conclusions that connect to Palestinian values—represent sophisticated narrative practices developed over centuries.

Palestinian educators now use the recording in cultural preservation programs, teaching children not just the stories themselves but the art of oral storytelling that sustained Palestinian culture through displacement. Community centers play the tape during cultural events, Sitt Fatima's voice bridging generations and geographical distances to maintain connections to traditional narrative practices.

## Object 73: The Traditional Medicine Herbs

### The Human Story

In her small kitchen garden behind their home in Gaza, Umm Ahmad tends to sage, za'atar, mint, and chamomile plants that her mother-in-law taught her to cultivate for their medicinal properties. Each herb serves specific therapeutic purposes passed down through generations of Palestinian women who understood plant medicine long before modern pharmaceutical companies existed. The garden represents both practical healthcare and cultural preservation, maintaining traditional knowledge in an environment where medical resources are often scarce.

Umm Ahmad learned herbal medicine from Palestinian women who treated common ailments with plants they could grow, gather, or purchase inexpensively at local markets. Sage tea for digestive problems, chamomile for anxiety and sleep disorders, za'atar mixed with olive oil for respiratory issues—each remedy comes with specific preparation instructions, dosage recommendations, and warnings about contraindications that represent centuries of accumulated folk medical knowledge.

The herbs take on additional significance under Gaza's medical blockade, where pharmaceutical supplies face restrictions and healthcare access remains limited. Traditional plant remedies provide affordable alternatives for treating minor ailments, reducing pressure on overwhelmed medical facilities while maintaining cultural practices that connect Palestinians to their agricultural heritage. Umm Ahmad's garden produces medicine as well as food, maximizing the utility of precious growing space.

Palestinian traditional medicine knowledge faces erosion as younger generations rely more on modern pharmaceuticals and less on plant-based remedies. Umm Ahmad worries that her daughters, educated in contemporary schools and influenced by global medical culture, will not continue the practices that sustained Palestinian communities for millennia. She carefully documents her recipes and preparation methods, hoping to preserve knowledge that might otherwise disappear.

The herbs also travel internationally through Palestinian diaspora networks. Umm Ahmad's sister in Jordan regularly sends packets of dried za'atar and other medicinal plants to relatives in the United States, where Palestinian-Americans use traditional remedies to treat their children's minor illnesses while maintaining connections to cultural practices. The herbs become vehicles for cultural transmission, carrying Palestinian knowledge across borders.

During periods of intense conflict, when medical facilities face bombardment and supply shortages, traditional herbal remedies provide crucial healthcare alternatives. Umm Ahmad recalls preparing chamomile tea to calm children during bombing raids, using mint to treat nausea caused by stress, and sharing herbal preparations with neighbors whose regular medications were unavailable. The plants in her garden became a community pharmacy, providing natural healthcare when conventional medicine was inaccessible.

## Object 74: The Refugee Camp School

### The Human Story

At 7:00 AM each morning, the metal door of Classroom 3B at the UNRWA elementary school in Shatila refugee camp creaks open to reveal thirty-eight Palestinian children crammed into a space designed for twenty-five. Their teacher, Ustaza Layla, has spent her own money to buy extra plastic chairs and arrange them in narrow rows that barely allow movement between desks. The walls, painted institutional green decades ago, display children's artwork depicting houses with red roofs and gardens—homes none of these children have ever seen but which represent their inherited dreams of return.

The school building, constructed in 1952 as a temporary solution for Palestinian refugee education, now serves its fourth generation of students. Concrete walls show cracks from decades of settling, windows lack proper frames allowing winter cold and summer heat to penetrate, and the single bathroom serves over two hundred children. Yet every morning, children arrive in pressed uniforms, carrying worn textbooks and determination to learn despite the physical constraints that define their educational environment.

Ustaza Layla, herself born in Shatila, represents the remarkable educational achievements possible within Palestinian refugee education systems. Despite limited resources, UNRWA schools consistently produce students who excel in Lebanese national examinations and compete successfully for university admissions. The contradiction between physical poverty and educational ambition defines the refugee camp school experience, where excellence emerges from adversity through collective commitment to learning.

The classroom walls tell stories of Palestinian identity preservation within Lebanese displacement. Children's projects explore Palestinian villages their grandparents fled in 1948, using internet research and family interviews to document places that no longer appear on maps. Geography lessons trace borders that changed before these children were born, while literature classes read Palestinian poets alongside Lebanese curriculum requirements. The school becomes a vehicle for cultural transmission that transcends national boundaries.

During economic crises that regularly affect Lebanon, Palestinian refugee families face impossible choices between basic necessities and educational expenses. Ustaza Layla has established a small fund, contributed to by Palestinian professionals worldwide, that provides school supplies, uniforms, and nutritious snacks for students whose families cannot afford these educational basics. The classroom refrigerator, donated by the Palestinian Women's Association, stores cheese sandwiches for children who arrive hungry.

Technology access remains extremely limited, with the school's single computer lab serving over eight hundred students. Yet children demonstrate remarkable adaptability, sharing smartphones for research projects and using social media platforms to connect with Palestinian students worldwide. Ustaza Layla marvels at her students' ability to navigate global digital culture while maintaining connections to Palestinian identity rooted in displacement and dreams of return.

## Object 75: The Community Radio

### The Human Story

Every evening at 8 PM, Palestinian refugees throughout Lebanon tune their radios to 93.7 FM to hear "Sawt al-Awda" (Voice of Return), a community radio program broadcast from a small studio in Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp. The program's host, Abu Khalil Mansour, speaks into a microphone that has carried Palestinian voices across the airwaves for over fifteen years, connecting scattered refugee communities with news, culture, and the persistent dream of return to their homeland.

The radio station operates from two cramped rooms in a residential building, its equipment cobbled together from donated components and volunteer technical expertise. The transmission power barely covers the Palestinian camps in southern Lebanon, but through internet streaming, the station reaches Palestinian communities worldwide. Listeners in Detroit email song requests, refugees in Jordan call with news updates, and Palestinian students in European universities share their voices during weekly diaspora segments.

Abu Khalil, himself born in the camp, learned radio broadcasting through trial and error after recognizing that mainstream Lebanese media rarely addressed Palestinian refugee concerns or perspectives. The community radio fills this gap, providing news analysis that considers Palestinian viewpoints, cultural programming that preserves traditional music and storytelling, and practical information about services available to refugee communities. The station becomes a lifeline for isolated populations seeking connection and information.

Programming reflects the diversity of Palestinian refugee experiences while maintaining focus on shared identity and aspirations. Morning shows feature discussions about daily challenges facing refugee communities—employment restrictions, educational barriers, healthcare access—while evening programs celebrate Palestinian culture through traditional music, poetry readings, and interviews with community elders sharing memories of pre-1948 village life.

The radio station faces constant financial pressure, operating entirely on community donations and volunteer labor. Equipment failures threaten broadcasts, while Lebanese broadcasting regulations require careful navigation to maintain legal operating status. Yet the station persists, sustained by community recognition of its essential role in maintaining Palestinian identity and internal communication networks among refugee populations.

During periods of increased tension or conflict in Palestine, listenership spikes dramatically as community members seek information and analysis unavailable through mainstream media sources. The radio becomes a crucial communication tool, broadcasting emergency information, coordinating community responses, and providing emotional support during crises that affect Palestinians worldwide. Abu Khalil's voice becomes a familiar comfort, maintaining connections between scattered Palestinian communities when other communication systems fail or prove inadequate.
