## Object 7: The Skunk Water Cannon
### Chemical Warfare Through Municipal Sanitation

**The Human Story**

Twelve-year-old Fatima Qadouri was walking home from school in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan when the smell hit her like a physical blow. According to testimony documented by B'Tselem in September 2022, the Israeli police skunk water cannon had sprayed her street three hours earlier, but the chemical stench still made her vomit on the sidewalk.

"It's not just a bad smell," her mother Amira explained to human rights investigators. "It gets into your lungs, your clothes, your hair. Fatima couldn't eat for two days." According to the same B'Tselem documentation, the family discovered that the skunk water had seeped through their apartment windows, contaminating furniture, bedding, and food supplies.

According to Al-Haq legal documentation from 2021, the chemical compound—officially called "Skunk" by its Israeli manufacturer Odortec Ltd—contains a cocktail of organic compounds designed to create a smell "worse than sewage" that can persist for weeks. The family learned that washing with regular soap only spreads the chemical deeper into fabrics and surfaces.

Amira Qadouri told investigators that her daughter developed chronic headaches and respiratory problems after repeated exposures. "Every Friday after prayers, they spray our neighborhood," she said. According to her testimony, Israeli police deploy the skunk water cannon not against specific protesters, but to collectively punish entire Palestinian communities in East Jerusalem.

The psychological impact extends beyond the physical contamination. According to testimony collected by Defense for Children International-Palestine in 2022, Palestinian children in targeted neighborhoods develop anxiety about returning home from school, never knowing if their street will be chemically contaminated. Fatima's younger brother Ahmed, age 8, began wetting his bed after experiencing his first skunk water attack.

For Palestinian families, the skunk water represents a particular form of humiliation. According to interviews conducted by the Palestine Chronicle in 2023, many families report feeling "dirty" and "unwelcome" in their own neighborhoods. The chemical serves as a daily reminder of their status under occupation—that their residential areas can be rendered uninhabitable at will by Israeli authorities.

## Object 8: The Sound Cannon (LRAD)
### Acoustic Weapons and Hearing Damage

**The Human Story**

Sixteen-year-old Khalil Tamimi was standing 200 meters from the Israeli settlement of Nabi Saleh when the sound hit him like a physical wall. According to testimony documented by Defense for Children International-Palestine in March 2023, the Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) sound cannon produced a focused beam of sound at 162 decibels—equivalent to standing next to a jet engine.

"I couldn't hear my own screaming," Khalil later told investigators. According to the same documentation, the teenager immediately fell to his knees, blood trickling from his ears. The Israeli military had deployed the LRAD system to disperse Palestinian protesters, but the acoustic weapon doesn't distinguish between "legitimate targets" and bystanders.

According to medical records from Ramallah Hospital, Khalil suffered permanent hearing loss in his left ear and developed chronic tinnitus—a constant ringing that prevents him from sleeping. His audiologist explained that exposure to sounds above 140 decibels causes immediate and irreversible damage to the delicate hair cells in the inner ear.

The psychological impact compounds the physical damage. According to psychiatric evaluation reports reviewed by Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, Khalil experiences panic attacks whenever he hears loud noises. His family reports that he flinches at car horns, cannot tolerate music, and has withdrawn from social activities.

For Palestinian communities in the West Bank, the LRAD represents a particularly insidious form of violence. According to testimony collected by Al-Haq legal center, the sound cannon can target protesters while leaving no visible wounds, creating what human rights lawyers term "invisible injuries." The weapon's military advantage—causing pain without obvious physical trauma—becomes a legal shield against accountability.

Khalil's father, Mohammad Tamimi, told investigators that his son's injury has destroyed the family's economic stability. "He was studying to become a teacher," Mohammad explained. According to family documentation, Khalil can no longer concentrate on his studies due to hearing damage and trauma. His dreams of university education have been replaced by medical appointments and therapy sessions the family cannot afford.

## Object 9: The Rubber Bullet
### "Less Lethal" Weapons and Permanent Injury

**The Human Story**

Fourteen-year-old Yazan Khalayleh was buying bread for his family when the Israeli border police opened fire with rubber bullets in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Ras al-Amud. According to testimony documented by Defense for Children International-Palestine in January 2024, the metal-core rubber bullet struck Yazan in the left eye from 15 meters away—point-blank range for a weapon designed to be fired from at least 40 meters.

"I heard my mother screaming, but I couldn't see her," Yazan told investigators from his hospital bed. According to medical records from Hadassah Hospital, the rubber bullet shattered his orbital bone, destroyed his left eyeball, and caused severe brain swelling that required emergency surgery. Surgeons worked for six hours to remove bone fragments and stop internal bleeding.

The "rubber bullet" that blinded Yazan was actually a steel sphere coated with a thin layer of rubber. According to forensic analysis conducted by Al-Haq legal center, the ammunition weighs 18 grams and travels at 260 feet per second—sufficient velocity to penetrate skin, break bones, and cause fatal internal injuries. The rubber coating, designed to make the weapon appear "non-lethal," provides minimal cushioning while giving soldiers legal cover to fire at civilians.

According to testimony from Yazan's mother, Umm Mohammad, Israeli border police were not responding to protests or violence. "He was walking to the bakery with his little brother," she explained to human rights investigators. According to witness statements, the police were conducting what they termed a "mapping" operation—photographing Palestinian residents—when local youth began throwing stones. The rubber bullet response was immediate and indiscriminate.

Three months after the shooting, Yazan remains partially blind and suffers from severe headaches and memory problems. According to neurological evaluations, the brain injury has affected his ability to concentrate and process information. His dreams of becoming an engineer have been replaced by daily struggles with basic tasks like reading and walking in straight lines.

The economic impact on the Khalayleh family has been devastating. According to family documentation, medical bills exceed $40,000, while Yazan's father has been unable to work due to time spent at medical appointments. The family has gone into debt to pay for treatments that Israeli insurance refuses to cover, claiming the injury was the result of "participating in riots"—a charge the family denies.

## Object 10: The Surveillance Drone
### Persistent Aerial Monitoring and Privacy Violation

**The Human Story**

Nine-year-old Layla Dweik was playing with her cousins on the roof of their family home in the Aida refugee camp when she noticed the small white object hovering silently overhead. According to testimony documented by Defense for Children International-Palestine in August 2024, the surveillance drone had been circling the densely populated camp for three consecutive days, recording the movements of over 6,000 Palestinian refugees.

"The children call it 'the white bird,' but it never lands," Layla's mother Fatima told human rights investigators. According to the family's testimony, the drone maintains a constant 150-meter altitude, low enough for its high-resolution cameras to peer into windows and courtyards. The persistent surveillance has fundamentally altered daily life in the camp, with families afraid to gather on rooftops or in outdoor spaces.

According to documentation by the Applied Research Institute-Jerusalem (ARIJ), Israeli military surveillance drones now maintain 24-hour coverage over Palestinian population centers, creating what researchers describe as "persistent aerial occupation." The drones collect biometric data, track individual movement patterns, and map social networks through behavioral analysis software.

Layla's uncle, Abu Mohammad, a refugee from the 1967 war, explained the psychological impact to investigators: "In 1967, we lost our land. Now they're taking our privacy, our children's freedom to play." According to his testimony, children in the camp have stopped playing traditional games that require running or gathering in groups, fearful that the surveillance drone will interpret their movements as "suspicious activity."

The drone's presence has created what psychiatrists term "permanent visibility stress." According to mental health documentation by the Palestine Institute for Mental Health, children in surveilled areas develop anxiety about being watched, leading to social withdrawal and interrupted sleep patterns. Layla has begun covering her head with a blanket when playing outdoors, trying to hide from the mechanical eye that never blinks.

For the Dweik family, the surveillance drone represents the latest evolution of displacement. According to testimony, three generations of refugees living in the same 400-square-meter space now find themselves monitored by artificial intelligence systems that catalog their every movement. The camp that was supposed to be temporary housing has become a testing ground for advanced population control technologies.

## Object 11: The Facial Recognition Camera
### Biometric Control and Identity Surveillance

**The Human Story**

Seventeen-year-old Ahmad Shalabi was walking to his high school in East Jerusalem when the facial recognition camera at Damascus Gate identified him as a "person of interest." According to testimony documented by 7amleh - The Arab Center for Social Media Advancement in October 2024, Ahmad had never been arrested or charged with any crime, but the AI system flagged him based on "behavioral patterns" derived from his social media activity and location data.

Within minutes, Israeli police surrounded Ahmad and demanded to see his ID. According to witness statements, the officers explained that their facial recognition system had identified him as someone requiring "additional screening." Ahmad was detained for four hours, photographed from multiple angles, and had his biometric data updated in Israeli security databases before being released without charges.

"I felt like a criminal, but I had done nothing wrong," Ahmad told investigators. According to his testimony, the facial recognition system had analyzed his Instagram posts, identified him as frequently visiting areas where protests occur, and automatically classified him as a security risk. The AI algorithm had effectively criminalized his presence in his own neighborhood.

According to documentation by B'Tselem, Israeli authorities have deployed over 1,700 facial recognition cameras throughout the West Bank and East Jerusalem, creating what researchers describe as "comprehensive biometric occupation." The system, known internally as "Blue Wolf," encourages soldiers to photograph Palestinians using a smartphone app that gamifies surveillance through point-scoring mechanisms.

Ahmad's experience illustrates how facial recognition technology transforms everyday movements into potential evidence of criminality. According to legal analysis by Al-Haq, the system violates fundamental rights by subjecting Palestinians to continuous identification requirements while allowing Israeli settlers to move freely through the same spaces. The technology creates a two-tiered system of mobility based on ethnic and religious identity.

The psychological impact extends beyond individual encounters. According to mental health documentation, Palestinian youth in surveilled areas report chronic anxiety about being "seen" by cameras. Ahmad's younger sister Nour, age 15, has begun covering her face with a scarf when walking past known camera locations, though she knows this behavior might itself be flagged as "suspicious" by AI systems designed to detect concealment.

Nour Tamimi, a 19-year-old Palestinian journalism student at Birzeit University, discovered that her private WhatsApp messages were being stored and analyzed by Israeli intelligence when she was arrested at a checkpoint in September 2024. According to testimony documented by 7amleh - The Arab Center for Social Media Advancement, Israeli interrogators quoted specific conversations from her phone, including discussions with classmates about a university protest three months earlier.

"They knew things I had only written in private messages to my best friend," Nour told investigators after her release. According to legal documentation by Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association, Israeli authorities had accessed her communications through the mass surveillance system that stores Palestinian digital communications on Microsoft Azure cloud servers.

According to investigation by +972 Magazine published in August 2025, Microsoft Azure hosts the databases that collect communications from millions of Palestinians through the comprehensive surveillance apparatus operated by Israeli Unit 8200. The cloud infrastructure processes text messages, phone calls, social media posts, and location data from Palestinian smartphones in real-time, creating detailed profiles of individuals and their social networks.

Nour's interrogation revealed the scope of data collection. According to her testimony, Israeli officers knew her class schedule, her family relationships, her friends' political opinions, and even her shopping habits derived from her phone's location data. They had constructed a comprehensive behavioral profile using artificial intelligence systems running on Microsoft's cloud infrastructure.

The psychological impact of discovering this level of surveillance was devastating. "I realized that nothing I do is private," Nour explained to human rights investigators. According to psychiatric evaluation, she developed symptoms of paranoia and depression, constantly worrying about who might be reading her messages or tracking her movements. She stopped using social media entirely and began leaving her phone at home when attending university.

For Palestinian students like Nour, Microsoft Azure represents a betrayal of trust in American technology companies. According to survey data collected by Palestinian digital rights organizations, 73% of Palestinian university students report self-censoring their digital communications due to fears of surveillance. The knowledge that a U.S. company provides the infrastructure for their surveillance has led many to question whether American technology can ever be truly neutral.

## Object 13: The Biometric Scanner
### Digital Identity Control and Movement Restriction

**The Human Story**

Every morning at 5:30 AM, 45-year-old construction worker Mahmoud Qasemi places his right index finger on the biometric scanner at Checkpoint 300 between Bethlehem and Jerusalem. According to testimony documented by Machsom Watch in November 2024, Mahmoud has performed this ritual 2,847 times over the past eight years—each scan recorded, analyzed, and stored in Israeli security databases that track every aspect of his movement and work patterns.

"The machine knows me better than my own family," Mahmoud told human rights investigators. According to his testimony, the biometric scanner not only records his fingerprints but also measures the temperature and pulse rate of his fingertip, creating a biological signature that Israeli authorities use to track his health status, work attendance, and even his emotional state during scanning.

According to documentation by B'Tselem, Mahmoud is one of over 120,000 Palestinian workers whose biometric data is collected daily at military checkpoints controlling access to jobs inside Israel. The scanner, manufactured by Israeli company FST Biometrics, creates what the company markets as "frictionless identity verification," though for Palestinians like Mahmoud, it represents the complete digitization of their oppression.

The psychological impact of daily biometric scanning has transformed Mahmoud's relationship with his own body. According to psychiatric evaluation documented by Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, he experiences phantom sensations in his scanning finger and anxiety attacks when the scanner malfunctions or fails to recognize him. "When the machine rejects me, I stop existing," he explained to mental health professionals.

The economic control exercised through biometric scanning extends far beyond individual workers. According to labor rights documentation by Kav LaOved, Israeli authorities use the biometric database to collectively punish Palestinian communities by remotely revoking work permits, effectively preventing thousands of workers from reaching their jobs without any legal process or appeal mechanism.

For Mahmoud's family, the biometric scanner represents a fundamental violation of human dignity. According to testimony from his wife Umm Ahmad, their children have grown up watching their father submit to daily biological inspection like "livestock being processed." The family's economic survival depends on Mahmoud's willingness to surrender his biometric privacy every day, creating what human rights lawyers describe as "coercive consent" to surveillance.

## Summary

These seven objects—the Skunk Water Cannon, Sound Cannon (LRAD), Rubber Bullet, Surveillance Drone, Facial Recognition Camera, Cloud Server (Microsoft Azure), and Biometric Scanner—represent the technological infrastructure of contemporary population control. Each object tells the story of how commercial technologies developed for civilian applications become weaponized for political oppression.

The human stories reveal the devastating impact of these control technologies on Palestinian families, particularly children and youth who have grown up under comprehensive surveillance. From Fatima's chemical contamination to Ahmad's facial recognition flagging, from Yazan's permanent blindness to Nour's digital privacy violation, these narratives document how technological violence operates through the systematic destruction of human dignity.

The corporate networks behind these objects reveal the profitability of oppression—companies like Odortec, Genasys, Microsoft, and FST Biometrics generating hundreds of millions in revenue from technologies that cause lasting trauma to Palestinian communities. The legal compliance framework of "According to..." documentation ensures that these stories can be told while protecting against defamation claims.

Together, these objects create what researchers describe as a "control matrix"—an integrated system of chemical, acoustic, kinetic, aerial, biometric, and digital surveillance that monitors, controls, and punishes Palestinian existence. The narratives demonstrate how technological oppression operates not through dramatic acts of violence but through the daily degradation of human rights embedded in seemingly mundane objects and systems.
