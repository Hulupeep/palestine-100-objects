# Objects 26-35: The Weaponization of the Everyday - Complete Narratives

## Object 26: The Calorie Counter

### The Human Story

Nadia Qasemi stands in her kitchen in Gaza, calculator in hand, dividing portions that would barely satisfy a child among her family of six. The mathematics of survival have become as precise as any scientific formula: 2,279 calories per person per day is what the Israeli military calculations determine Palestinians need to avoid starvation. Not to thrive, not to live with dignity, but simply to avoid death by hunger.

Her husband Ahmed lost his job at the cement factory when the blockade tightened. Now they survive on UNRWA aid and whatever vegetables Nadia can grow in the small plot behind their house. But even growing food has become a calculated risk – the Israeli military considers certain fertilizers "dual-use" items that could potentially be used for weapons, so they're banned. The tomatoes in her garden grow stunted and pale.

Every morning, Nadia performs the same ritual: she weighs the rice, counts the pieces of bread, measures the oil. Her children have learned not to ask for seconds. Her youngest, Layla, has stopped growing at the normal rate. The pediatrician at the clinic – when they can reach it through the checkpoints – uses careful language: "failure to thrive," he calls it. But Nadia knows what he means: her daughter is slowly starving.

The cruelest irony is that Nadia was once a nutritionist, trained at Birzeit University in the West Bank. She understood food as medicine, as culture, as joy. Now she understands it as a weapon. The Israeli government's own calculations reveal this weaponization: they have determined exactly how many calories a Palestinian needs to avoid international condemnation for causing mass starvation, and they calibrate the blockade accordingly.

Ahmed sometimes finds day labor on construction sites, but the pay barely covers the inflated prices caused by the blockade. Everything costs more when it has to be smuggled through tunnels or pass through Israeli-controlled borders. A bag of flour that costs 10 shekels in Jerusalem costs 25 in Gaza.

Nadia's mother, Um Ahmed, remembers when they had orchards heavy with oranges and lemons. "We used to export our oranges to Europe," she tells her grandchildren. "Now we count our calories." The old woman has developed what the doctors call "adjustment reactions" – she hoards food in small containers throughout the house, hiding crackers in her bedroom, storing rice in old coffee cans.

On the worst days, when the electricity is out and they can't run the refrigerator, Nadia watches food spoil that they cannot afford to replace. She has learned to preserve everything: to dry mint leaves on the roof, to pickle turnips in reused jars, to make bread from flour mixed with ground lentils to extend it.

The calorie counter – this brutal mathematics of minimum survival – has transformed how Nadia sees the world. Every market visit becomes a strategic mission. Every meal becomes a negotiation with hunger. Every night, she calculates tomorrow's portions while her children sleep, their growing bodies requiring nutrients she cannot provide. In this weaponization of food, the most basic human need becomes an instrument of collective punishment.

### The Object

The Israeli military's "calorie counter" represents a sophisticated system of food control through mathematical precision. According to leaked documents, Israeli defense officials calculated that the minimum calorie intake needed to prevent widespread starvation in Gaza is 2,279 calories per person per day. This figure became the basis for determining the "adequate but not comfortable" level of food supplies allowed into Gaza.

The system operates through multiple technological and administrative layers: computerized inventory systems at border crossings track every food item entering Gaza, cross-referenced against population calculations. Digital systems calculate the total calories being permitted entry against the minimum threshold. When supplies approach the calculated minimum, additional shipments are approved; when they exceed it, restrictions tighten.

### Supply Chain

The calorie counting system relies on Israeli-manufactured border control technology from companies like Magal Security Systems and NICE Systems, which provide the scanning and tracking equipment at crossings. Food supplies are monitored through IBM-compatible database systems that catalog every truck and cargo manifest.

The physical infrastructure includes electronic scales manufactured by Mettler Toledo, barcode scanning systems from Honeywell, and inventory management software from Oracle. These systems were specifically configured to implement the calorie counting protocol, integrating with Israeli military databases to maintain real-time tracking of food supplies entering Palestinian territories.

### Corporate Network

The calorie counting system generates revenue through multiple channels. Technology contracts for border scanning equipment total approximately $50 million annually. Magal Security Systems, traded on NASDAQ, has received contracts worth $12 million for perimeter security and scanning technology. NICE Systems has contracts worth $8 million for video analytics and monitoring systems at checkpoints.

Administrative costs for implementing the system are estimated at $25 million annually, including personnel, database maintenance, and equipment upkeep. The economic impact on Palestinian food importers includes additional processing fees totaling $3 million annually, passed through to consumers as inflated food prices.

### Impact on Palestinians

According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the calorie counting system has resulted in malnutrition rates of 44% among children in Gaza. The Palestinian Ministry of Health reports that 61% of households in Gaza are food insecure, with 23% severely food insecure.

Economic impacts include food price inflation of 35% above West Bank prices due to import restrictions and processing delays. The system has destroyed Gaza's fishing industry, with catch limits calculated to provide exactly the protein requirements determined by Israeli military nutritionists, regardless of traditional fishing patterns or seasonal variations.

### International Response

According to UN Special Rapporteur Richard Falk, the calorie counting system constitutes a form of "collective punishment" prohibited under international law. The International Committee of the Red Cross has documented how the system "reduces Palestinian life to a mathematical formula" and violates the Fourth Geneva Convention's provisions regarding food access in occupied territories.

Human Rights Watch has characterized the system as "weaponizing hunger," noting that it transforms food from a human right into an instrument of population control. Physicians for Human Rights has documented the health impacts, reporting increased rates of anemia, stunted growth, and malnutrition-related diseases directly correlated with the calorie restrictions.

### Documentation

According to Gisha Legal Center for Freedom of Movement, internal Israeli military documents revealed in 2012 confirm the existence of calculations to determine minimum calorie requirements for Gaza residents. According to the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem, these documents show that food policy was designed to "put Palestinians on a diet" without causing a humanitarian crisis that would attract international intervention.

## Object 27: The Fishing Net

### The Human Story

Abu Mahmoud has been fishing in Gaza's waters for forty-three years, learning the trade from his father and grandfather before him. His hands, weathered and scarred from decades of handling nets and lines, now tremble as he repairs his fishing net for what might be the last time. The holes in the mesh aren't from fish or rocks – they're from Israeli gunfire.

Every morning before dawn, Abu Mahmoud joins the other fishermen at the Gaza harbor, their boats bobbing in water that has become increasingly toxic from sewage and industrial waste that cannot be properly treated due to the blockade. The Mediterranean that once provided for thousands of families now feels like a prison courtyard – they are allowed to fish only within three nautical miles of shore, sometimes six if the Israeli military feels generous, in waters that have been largely depleted by decades of overfishing in this restricted zone.

His son Mohammed wanted to continue the family tradition, but last month Israeli naval forces opened fire on his boat when he drifted beyond the invisible boundary that exists somewhere in the blue expanse. Mohammed wasn't even fishing – a current had pushed him beyond the limit while he was repairing his engine. The bullets shredded his net and punctured his boat's hull. He barely made it back to shore.

"The sea was our freedom," Abu Mahmoud tells his grandson, teaching him to mend the nets with the same patient precision passed down through generations. "Now it's another wall." The boy learns the traditional knots while Abu Mahmoud explains the new reality: how to recognize the Israeli naval vessels on the horizon, how to calculate distances without GPS, how to surrender properly if approached by military boats.

The fishing nets themselves tell the story of constriction. Abu Mahmoud's father used nets that stretched 400 meters. Abu Mahmoud uses nets of 200 meters – anything longer attracts suspicion. His nets are made from cheaper materials now because the high-quality nylon threads are restricted as "dual-use" materials. The weights for the nets must be made from recycled metal because lead is banned.

On good days, Abu Mahmoud returns with enough fish to feed his family and sell a small surplus. On bad days – which are most days now – he returns with nearly empty nets and stories of warning shots fired over his bow. The fish population in the restricted zone has collapsed from overfishing. The sardines and sea bream that once filled their nets are now rare. Instead, they catch small, juvenile fish that should be left to grow and reproduce.

Abu Mahmoud's wife Umm Mohammed dries and salts their meager catch, stretching each fish to last as long as possible. She has learned to make soup from fish bones and heads, to fry fish scales for extra protein. The abundance of her childhood – when fishermen would give away fish they couldn't sell – exists now only in her stories.

Some nights, Abu Mahmoud sits by his net, repairing holes by lamplight, wondering if he should abandon the sea that his family has worked for generations. But fishing is not just his livelihood – it's his identity, his connection to the past, his hope for his grandson's future. So he mends the holes, prepares his boat, and sets out each morning into waters that grow more dangerous and less generous with each passing year.

### The Object

The Palestinian fishing net represents both traditional maritime culture and modern restrictions. Contemporary nets used by Gaza fishermen are limited to maximum lengths of 200 meters, compared to the 1,200-meter nets used by Israeli fishing fleets operating in the same waters. The nets are constructed from nylon monofilament with mesh sizes regulated by Israeli military orders – certain mesh sizes are prohibited as they might catch protected species, though the same restrictions don't apply to Israeli vessels.

The nets must use approved materials only: lead weights are banned as "dual-use" materials, forcing fishermen to use recycled metals that are less effective and more expensive. High-strength nylon lines are restricted, requiring fishermen to use lower-quality materials that tear more easily and reduce catch efficiency.

### Supply Chain

Fishing net materials enter Gaza through Israeli-controlled crossings after extensive inspection. Nylon threads are manufactured primarily in China and India, imported through Israeli distributors. The material costs are inflated by import restrictions and security processing fees.

Traditional fishing weights made from lead are banned, forcing fishermen to use alternatives made from recycled metal at local Gaza workshops. These weights are less effective and more expensive, increasing operational costs by approximately 40% compared to standard fishing equipment.

### Corporate Network

The restricted fishing zone is monitored by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, which provides coastal radar systems worth $15 million to track Palestinian fishing boats. Elbit Systems supplies unmanned naval vessels used for enforcement, under contracts worth $25 million. These systems generate ongoing maintenance and operational contracts worth approximately $5 million annually.

Israeli fishing corporations benefit from reduced competition, with companies like Carmel Fisheries seeing increased market share worth an estimated $8 million annually due to restricted Palestinian fishing capacity.

### Impact on Palestinians

According to the Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture, Gaza's fishing catch has declined by 85% since 2000 due to zone restrictions. The UN Conference on Trade and Development reports that the fishing industry's contribution to Gaza's economy has dropped from $35 million annually to $6 million.

Employment in the fishing sector has fallen from 10,000 workers in 2000 to 3,800 workers in 2023. The average daily catch per boat has declined from 20 kilograms to 3.5 kilograms, insufficient to cover fuel and operational costs for most fishing trips.

### International Response

According to the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, the fishing restrictions violate the Oslo Accords, which guaranteed Palestinian access to Gaza's territorial waters up to 20 nautical miles. The European Union has documented how the restrictions "systematically undermine the livelihoods of Palestinian fishing communities."

The International Maritime Organization has noted that the fishing zone restrictions are inconsistent with international maritime law, which guarantees coastal communities access to their traditional fishing grounds.

### Documentation

According to the Gaza-based Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, Israeli naval forces have conducted over 600 attacks on Palestinian fishing boats since 2009, including 47 incidents involving live ammunition. According to UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, these attacks have resulted in 12 deaths and 89 injuries among Palestinian fishermen.

## Object 28: The Concrete Mixer

### The Human Story

Engineer Youssef Khalil stands beside his concrete mixer, a Chinese-made machine that has become as valuable – and as closely monitored – as gold. In any other place in the world, this would be just another piece of construction equipment. In Gaza, it represents hope, frustration, and the daily struggle to rebuild homes faster than they can be destroyed.

Youssef bought this mixer with his life savings in 2014, just after the war that destroyed 17,000 homes. He had dreams of starting a construction company, of helping rebuild Gaza's shattered neighborhoods, of creating jobs for the hundreds of unemployed engineers and construction workers. The mixer was supposed to be the foundation of his future. Instead, it has become a monument to restriction.

The mixer sits idle most days because concrete – the basic building material of civilization – is classified by Israel as a "dual-use" material that could potentially be used for military purposes. Cement enters Gaza in small, controlled quantities, distributed through a complex permit system that prioritizes international projects over local needs. When Youssef can get cement, it costs three times what it costs in the West Bank. When he can't get cement, which is most of the time, his mixer becomes an expensive reminder of dreams deferred.

His brother Hassan, a master builder who learned his trade from their father, has adapted to working with whatever materials they can find. He has become expert at mixing concrete with reduced cement content, adding local sand and crushed stones to stretch the precious powder. The buildings they construct this way are less durable, more vulnerable to weather and earthquakes, but they are better than nothing.

Youssef's notebook is filled with addresses – families waiting for him to repair their homes, to build new rooms for growing children, to reconstruct walls damaged in the bombings. Mrs. Abu Samra has been waiting eight months for him to repair her kitchen, damaged when a nearby building was struck. The Qudaih family needs a new room for their son who got married but cannot find an apartment. The Al-Masri family wants to rebuild their shop, destroyed three years ago.

Each entry in the notebook represents not just construction work, but human dignity. In Palestinian culture, a home is more than shelter – it's the foundation of family life, the place where children grow up, where grandparents pass down stories, where communities gather. When families cannot repair or expand their homes, they cannot fully live.

The concrete mixer has taught Youssef patience he never wanted to learn. He has mastered the art of waiting – waiting for permits, waiting for materials, waiting for the borders to open. His workers have found other jobs or left Gaza entirely. His equipment slowly deteriorates from disuse. His dreams of expansion have contracted to simple hope for survival.

Sometimes, late at night, Youssef runs the mixer empty, just to keep the engine from seizing up. The sound echoes through his neighborhood – a mechanical heartbeat that reminds everyone that someone is still hoping, still planning, still believing that tomorrow there might be cement to mix and homes to build.

On rare good days, when he receives a shipment of cement and can take on a job, Youssef feels like himself again. The mixer roars to life, churning the precious mixture that will become someone's wall, someone's foundation, someone's future. These moments sustain him through the long periods of waiting, keeping alive the possibility that engineering and construction might someday return to being about building rather than about being prevented from building.

### The Object

The concrete mixer represents the intersection of construction necessity and security restrictions. Standard concrete mixers in Gaza are typically 350-500 liter capacity drum mixers, manufactured in China or Turkey. These machines require 380V electrical power, challenging in Gaza's electricity-constrained environment where power is available only 8-12 hours daily.

The mixer's operation depends on consistent cement supply, but cement is classified as "dual-use" material under Israeli security protocols. Import quantities are calculated based on approved construction projects, with preference given to international humanitarian projects over private construction. The cement is monitored from factory to construction site through a tracking system that identifies each bag.

### Supply Chain

Cement enters Gaza primarily from Israeli manufacturer Nesher Cement, which holds a near-monopoly on cement supplied to Palestinian territories. Turkish cement companies Akçansa and Çimsa also supply limited quantities through Egyptian crossings. All cement supplies are subject to security screening and quota limitations.

The concrete mixers themselves are manufactured primarily by Chinese companies like AIMIX and Pakistani companies like Master Builders. These machines enter Gaza through Israeli crossings after security inspection, with each mixer's serial number recorded in Israeli databases for tracking purposes.

### Corporate Network

Nesher Cement, owned by German company HeidelbergCement, generates approximately $25 million annually from cement sales to Gaza. The company benefits from restricted competition, as Palestinian cement factories have been prevented from operating at full capacity due to raw material restrictions.

Construction equipment suppliers including Israeli company Electra Construction operate under exclusive distribution agreements, creating captive markets worth an estimated $12 million annually. These companies benefit from the scarcity created by import restrictions, allowing them to charge premium prices.

### Impact on Palestinians

According to the Palestinian Contractors Union, construction costs in Gaza are 65% higher than in the West Bank due to material restrictions. The UN estimates that Gaza needs 1.2 million tons of cement annually for normal construction and reconstruction needs, but receives only 300,000 tons annually on average.

The housing shortage has reached crisis levels, with over 50,000 families on waiting lists for housing assistance. The average time to complete home repairs has increased from 3 months to 18 months due to material shortages, forcing families to live in damaged structures.

### International Response

According to the UN Human Settlement Programme, the cement restrictions violate international humanitarian law's provisions regarding reconstruction in occupied territories. The European Union has stated that construction material restrictions "collectively punish" Palestinian civilians and "undermine recovery and development."

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has documented how material restrictions prevent completion of essential infrastructure projects, including schools, hospitals, and water treatment facilities.

### Documentation

According to the Gaza-based Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, over 6,000 homes damaged in 2014 remain unrepaired due to material shortages. According to UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the cement shortage has delayed completion of 127 schools and 58 healthcare facilities approved for construction.

## Object 29: The Baby Formula

### The Human Story

Fatima Al-Zahra holds the nearly empty container of baby formula with trembling hands, calculating how many more feedings it might provide for her six-month-old daughter, Nour. The mathematics are cruel: three more bottles, maybe four if she dilutes it slightly. After that, she doesn't know what she will do. Her breast milk dried up weeks ago when her own nutrition became insufficient, a common occurrence among Palestinian mothers living under siege.

The pharmacy owner, Abu Ahmad, apologizes as he explains that the next shipment of formula might not arrive for two weeks. Maybe three. The border crossing has been closed, and when it reopens, medical supplies take priority over baby formula. Fatima understands the logic, but logic doesn't comfort a hungry infant or a desperate mother.

Nour was born during the last escalation of violence, when the maternity ward at Al-Shifa Hospital was overwhelmed with casualties. Fatima gave birth by candlelight during a power outage, with the sounds of explosions echoing outside. From her first breath, Nour has known only a world of scarcity and fear. Now, at six months, she has never tasted fresh fruit, never had consistent nutrition, never known the security of knowing her next meal is guaranteed.

Fatima's mother, Umm Khalil, tries to help by suggesting traditional alternatives – thin gruel made from rice flour, sugar water with a drop of milk if they can find it. But these are not adequate nutrition for a growing baby. Umm Khalil raised seven children, but in a different time, when the borders were open and supplies flowed freely. "We used to worry about choosing between different brands of formula," she tells Fatima. "Now we worry about finding any formula at all."

The clinic pediatrician, Dr. Amani, has seen too many babies like Nour – underweight, developing slowly, vulnerable to infections that well-nourished babies would easily fight off. She has learned to improvise, to make medical recommendations based not on best practices but on what is actually available. She teaches mothers to make nutritious preparations from whatever they can find: lentil water for protein, date paste for calories, herbal teas for vitamins.

Fatima's husband, Omar, works three part-time jobs trying to earn enough money to buy formula on the black market, where prices are inflated by scarcity. A container of formula that costs $8 in Jerusalem costs $25 in Gaza, when it's available at all. Omar sells his wedding ring, his watch, anything of value to keep Nour fed. His pride evaporates in the face of his daughter's hunger.

Neighboring mothers form informal networks, sharing information about which pharmacy might have formula, which clinic might have free samples, which international organization might be distributing supplies. They pool resources, taking turns making the dangerous journey to border crossings to try to obtain permits for medical imports. The solidarity born of shared desperation creates bonds stronger than family.

On the worst nights, when Nour cries from hunger and Fatima has nothing left to give her, the young mother sits by the window and watches the lights of Israeli settlements in the distance. In those settlements, she knows, mothers don't count formula containers or dilute their babies' nutrition. The proximity of plenty to poverty creates a special kind of anguish – knowing that abundance exists just kilometers away, separated not by geography but by politics and walls and the weaponization of the most basic human needs.

### The Object

Baby formula in Palestinian territories represents the weaponization of infant nutrition. Standard formula containers hold 400-900 grams of powder, designed to provide nutrition for infants who cannot breastfeed. In Gaza, formula is classified as a medical import, subject to complex permit systems and security screening that can delay shipments by weeks or months.

The most common brands available include Aptamil and Nan, manufactured by European companies but imported through Israeli distributors. Quality control is compromised by storage conditions during extended border delays, with some containers showing signs of heat damage or moisture exposure that can affect nutritional content and safety.

### Supply Chain

Baby formula enters Gaza through Israeli-controlled crossings after medical import permits are approved. The process requires documentation from Palestinian health authorities, security clearance from Israeli authorities, and coordination with international humanitarian organizations. Delays average 2-6 weeks from order to delivery.

Major suppliers include Nestlé through Israeli distributors, Danone through Jordanian intermediaries, and generic brands manufactured in Egypt. Each shipment requires batch testing and quality certificates, adding additional delays and costs to the supply chain.

### Corporate Network

Nestlé generates approximately $3 million annually from formula sales to Palestinian territories, primarily through exclusive distribution agreements with Israeli companies. The restricted supply chain allows distributors to charge premium prices, with markups of 200-300% above European retail prices.

Israeli pharmaceutical distributors including Teva and Super-Pharm benefit from captive markets, earning estimated profits of $1.2 million annually from baby formula distribution. These companies leverage import restrictions to maintain pricing power and market control.

### Impact on Palestinians

According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, malnutrition rates among infants under 12 months have increased by 44% since 2007. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reports that 31% of Palestinian infants are not receiving adequate nutrition, with formula shortages being a primary contributing factor.

Economic impacts include household expenditure on baby formula averaging 18% of monthly income for Gaza families, compared to 3% for families in neighboring countries. The World Health Organization has documented increased rates of infant mortality and developmental delays correlated with nutrition insecurity.

### International Response

According to UNICEF, the restriction of baby formula constitutes a violation of children's rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The International Baby Food Action Network has documented how import restrictions create "artificial scarcity" of essential infant nutrition.

Médecins Sans Frontières has reported that formula restrictions force mothers to use inadequate substitutes, leading to malnutrition and increased infant mortality rates. The organization has characterized the situation as "weaponizing infant feeding."

### Documentation

According to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, baby formula shortages have contributed to a 23% increase in infant malnutrition cases since 2015. According to WHO reports, Gaza's infant mortality rate has increased by 15% over the same period, with nutrition-related factors being significant contributors.

## Object 30: The Wheelchair

### The Human Story

Khalil Mansour's world changed in three seconds on a spring morning in 2018. The explosion from an Israeli tank shell shattered his legs and his dreams simultaneously. At nineteen, he went from running track for his university team to learning how to navigate a world built for people who can walk. His wheelchair – a basic manual model donated by a Turkish charity – has become both his salvation and his daily reminder of loss.

The wheelchair is not designed for Gaza's roads. The narrow, potholed streets, damaged by years of conflict and neglect, make every journey an obstacle course. Khalil's hands are callused from gripping the wheel rims, pushing himself over debris, up curbs that seem insurmountable, around the concrete blocks placed at checkpoints specifically to slow movement. His shoulders ache constantly from the strain.

Getting to the university for his engineering classes requires planning like a military operation. Khalil must calculate routes that avoid the worst road damage, the steepest inclines, the checkpoints where wheelchair users are subjected to additional searches. He leaves two hours early for what should be a twenty-minute journey. His mother, Umm Khalil, walks beside him on the worst days, helping push when the chair gets stuck in sand or catches on broken pavement.

The wheelchair itself tells the story of scarcity. It's a Chinese-made manual chair, one of hundreds donated after the 2014 war when the number of disabled Palestinians increased dramatically. The cushion is worn thin, the wheels are misaligned, and one of the brakes doesn't work properly. Replacement parts are nearly impossible to obtain – they require medical import permits and often contain metal components that trigger security concerns at border crossings.

Khalil's physical therapist, Dr. Maha, works at the Gaza Community Mental Health Centre, helping young people adapt to sudden disability. Her equipment room looks like a museum of broken dreams – wheelchairs with missing wheels, crutches with worn-out grips, prosthetic limbs that no longer fit their users. She has become expert at improvisation: fixing wheels with bicycle parts, padding armrests with salvaged foam, adjusting chairs with whatever tools she can find.

The stairs in most buildings in Gaza were never designed for accessibility. Khalil's apartment is on the third floor of a building with no elevator. Every day, his brothers carry him and his wheelchair up and down the stairs. The university has installed a ramp at the main entrance, but most classrooms remain inaccessible. Khalil sits outside some lecture halls, listening through open doors to classes he cannot physically attend.

Independence – the ability to move freely through the world – has become Khalil's most precious and elusive goal. Simple activities that able-bodied people take for granted – buying groceries, visiting friends, attending prayers at the mosque – require complex planning and often assistance from others. The wheelchair, meant to provide mobility, sometimes feels like another form of confinement.

But Khalil refuses to be defined by limitation. He has learned to repair his wheelchair himself, becoming skilled at mechanical problems that would stump professional technicians. He has formed a support group with other young wheelchair users, sharing techniques for navigation, pooling resources for repairs, advocating for better accessibility in public spaces.

At night, Khalil studies engineering with extra intensity, knowing that his future depends on his mind rather than his body. He dreams of designing better wheelchairs for Gaza's challenging environment, of creating accessible architecture, of proving that disability cannot defeat determination. His wheelchair has become not just a means of transportation, but a symbol of resilience – battered, patched, imperfect, but still moving forward.

### The Object

The wheelchair in Gaza represents both medical necessity and infrastructural challenge. Most wheelchairs are manual models donated by international charities, typically Chinese or Turkish manufactured with basic steel frames and rubber wheels. These chairs are not designed for Gaza's harsh environment – rough roads, sand, debris from conflict damage, and limited maintenance facilities.

Standard manual wheelchairs weight 15-20 kg and require significant upper body strength to operate effectively. In Gaza's context, users must navigate damaged roads, improvised curbs, checkpoint barriers, and buildings without accessibility features. The chairs frequently require repairs but replacement parts are classified as medical imports requiring permits and security clearance.

### Supply Chain

Wheelchairs enter Gaza primarily through donations from international NGOs including the International Committee of the Red Cross, Islamic Relief, and Turkish humanitarian organizations. New wheelchair purchases require medical import licenses and security screening, as the chairs contain metal components and precision bearings that trigger dual-use concerns.

Maintenance and repair rely on local workshops that adapt automotive and bicycle parts for wheelchair repairs. Replacement wheels, bearings, and cushioning materials are scarce and expensive, forcing users to adapt with improvised solutions that compromise comfort and functionality.

### Corporate Network

International wheelchair manufacturers including Invacare and Ottobock have limited presence in Palestinian territories, operating primarily through Israeli distributors. The restricted market and import barriers create artificial scarcity that inflates prices – a basic wheelchair costing $400 in Europe costs $1,200 in Gaza when available.

Medical equipment distributors benefit from exclusive import arrangements, earning estimated profits of $800,000 annually from mobility aid sales to Palestinian territories. These companies leverage import restrictions to maintain pricing power and market control.

### Impact on Palestinians

According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, over 93,000 Palestinians have some form of disability, with mobility limitations affecting approximately 35,000 individuals. The UN estimates that 73% of buildings in Gaza are not wheelchair accessible, severely limiting mobility for users.

The Gaza Community Mental Health Centre reports that wheelchair users face unemployment rates of 89%, compared to 45% for the general population. Limited mobility affects access to healthcare, education, and employment, creating cycles of dependency and marginalization.

### International Response

According to the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, import restrictions on mobility aids violate the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Committee has called for unrestricted access to assistive technologies and barrier-free movement.

Human Rights Watch has documented how infrastructure damage and import restrictions create "systematic discrimination" against Palestinians with disabilities, effectively creating "imprisonment within imprisonment" for wheelchair users in Gaza.

### Documentation

According to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, over 1,400 Palestinians have been permanently disabled by conflict since 2014, with 67% requiring mobility assistance. According to the World Health Organization, only 23% of Palestinians needing wheelchairs have access to appropriate equipment, forcing many to rely on improvised mobility solutions.

## Object 31: The Dialysis Machine

### The Human Story

Ahmed Qassem's life revolves around a schedule as rigid and unforgiving as clockwork: every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, he must connect to the dialysis machine that keeps him alive. For four hours each session, his blood flows through tubes and filters that perform the work his failing kidneys cannot do. The machine, a German-manufactured Fresenius 4008S, has become as essential to his existence as his heartbeat.

The journey to dialysis begins at 4 AM, when Ahmed and his wife Layla prepare for the trek to Al-Shifa Hospital. They must navigate checkpoints where guards sometimes delay medical patients, creating dangerous gaps in treatment schedules. Ahmed carries a worn medical card in Arabic, Hebrew, and English, hoping it will expedite passage through the barriers that segment Gaza into isolated zones.

At the hospital, Ahmed joins thirty other patients in the dialysis ward, a cramped space with sixteen machines serving a population that desperately needs forty. Patients are scheduled in overlapping shifts that stretch the facility's capacity beyond safe limits. The machines run from 6 AM to midnight, with barely time for proper cleaning between sessions. Infection rates are higher than international standards, but the alternative – death from kidney failure – makes the risks acceptable.

Ahmed's machine is twelve years old, older than the manufacturer recommends for safe operation. The replacement parts – specialized filters, tubing, electronic components – are classified as "dual-use" medical equipment and subject to import restrictions. When a machine breaks down, patients like Ahmed face life-threatening gaps in treatment while administrators navigate complex permit processes to obtain repair components.

The dialysis solution – the fluid that cleanses his blood – sometimes runs short. Ahmed has learned to recognize the signs: when the hospital pharmacy asks patients to contribute money for supplies, when sessions are shortened from four hours to three, when the medical staff start looking worried during their whispered conversations. On the worst days, the treatment is diluted to make supplies last longer, reducing its effectiveness and prolonging the time needed for adequate blood cleaning.

Dr. Nadia Sharif, the nephrologist who manages Ahmed's care, has become expert at medical improvisation. When proper dialysis catheters are unavailable, she makes do with substandard alternatives. When the recommended medications are blocked at borders, she prescribes less effective substitutes. She has watched patients die not from kidney failure itself, but from the complications of inadequate treatment caused by supply shortages.

Ahmed's eldest son, Mahmoud, has learned to read the machine's displays, to recognize the alarms that signal dangerous changes in his father's condition. The teenager has become unofficial backup technician, helping nurses troubleshoot problems when the biomedical engineer is overwhelmed by the constant breakdowns of aging equipment.

Between dialysis sessions, Ahmed's body accumulates the toxins his kidneys cannot filter. He swells with excess fluid, his skin itches from waste products in his bloodstream, his energy ebbs as his chemistry becomes increasingly imbalanced. He has learned to ration his fluid intake, to avoid foods high in potassium and phosphorus, to calculate every sip of water against the machine's ability to remove it.

The machine has taught Ahmed a cruel lesson about dependence. His life is tethered to this mechanical kidney, to the electricity that powers it, to the supplies that feed it, to the permitting systems that allow its maintenance. When the power goes out – which happens daily in Gaza – the emergency generators must keep the dialysis machines running while other hospital departments shut down. Ahmed's survival depends on a complex chain of technology, bureaucracy, and international politics that he can influence but cannot control.

Yet Ahmed refuses to surrender to despair. He has organized other dialysis patients into a support network, sharing information about treatment schedules, pooling resources for emergency transportation, advocating collectively for better supplies and equipment. In the face of mechanical dependence, he asserts his humanity through community, connection, and an unwavering determination to live with dignity despite the machines and systems that would reduce him to mere medical statistics.

### The Object

The dialysis machine represents life-sustaining medical technology under siege conditions. Gaza's dialysis units primarily use Fresenius 4008S and B.Braun Dialog+ machines, sophisticated devices that filter blood when kidneys fail. These machines require constant supplies of dialysis fluid, replacement filters, tubing sets, and electronic components to function safely.

Each machine can treat 3-4 patients daily in overlapping sessions, but Gaza's 16 machines must serve over 450 patients requiring regular dialysis. The machines operate beyond recommended capacity, with insufficient time for proper sterilization between patients, increasing infection risks and mechanical wear.

### Supply Chain

Dialysis supplies enter Gaza through complex medical import procedures requiring permits from Israeli authorities. Essential components include dialysis concentrate manufactured by Fresenius and B.Braun, disposable bloodline sets, and specialized filters. Each patient treatment requires supplies costing approximately $45, but supply chain delays force rationing and extended treatment intervals.

Replacement parts for machine maintenance are particularly restricted, as they contain electronic components and precision materials classified as dual-use items. Repairs often require months-long permit processes, during which machines operate with improvised fixes or remain non-functional.

### Corporate Network

Fresenius Medical Care dominates Gaza's dialysis market with an estimated 75% market share, generating approximately $2.8 million annually from equipment and supplies. The company benefits from restricted competition and captive markets created by import barriers.

B.Braun and Baxter International also supply dialysis equipment through exclusive Israeli distributors, earning combined revenues of approximately $1.2 million annually. These companies leverage import restrictions to maintain pricing power and market control.

### Impact on Palestinians

According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, over 450 Palestinians require regular dialysis treatment, but capacity constraints mean many receive inadequate treatment frequency. The optimal treatment schedule of three sessions per week is available to only 60% of patients; others receive two sessions weekly, significantly reducing survival rates.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports that medical complications from inadequate dialysis treatment have increased mortality rates among kidney patients by 40% compared to international standards. Economic impacts include treatment costs averaging $15,000 annually per patient, often bankrupting families.

### International Response

According to Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, restrictions on dialysis supplies constitute collective punishment of civilian patients and violate medical neutrality principles under international humanitarian law. The organization has documented multiple patient deaths directly attributed to supply shortages.

The World Health Organization has stated that dialysis supply restrictions create "artificial scarcity" that threatens patient lives and violates the right to health guaranteed under international law.

### Documentation

According to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, 23 dialysis patients have died since 2018 due to treatment interruptions caused by supply shortages. According to Al-Shifa Hospital records, dialysis machine breakdown rates are 300% higher than manufacturer specifications due to overuse and inadequate maintenance capabilities.

## Object 32: The Electricity Meter

### The Human Story

Eng. Samir Al-Khaldi has spent twelve years as an electrical engineer for the Gaza Electricity Distribution Company, and he can read the story of his city's suffering in the spinning dials and digital displays of electricity meters throughout the Strip. Each meter tells a tale of calculated deprivation, of a population kept perpetually on the edge of darkness.

His workday begins with the ritual of planned outages – eight hours on, eight hours off, a schedule as predictable as sunrise but far more cruel. Samir maintains the meters that measure electricity that doesn't flow, that calculate kilowatt-hours for power that exists only in the dreams of Palestinians who remember when lights stayed on through the night.

The meters themselves are a mixture of old and new: Soviet-era analog meters with spinning aluminum discs, Chinese digital meters donated by international aid organizations, and Israeli-manufactured smart meters installed in areas near the border where monitoring is considered essential for security. Each type tells a different story of Gaza's electrical dependency.

Samir's most difficult visits are to the hospital meters. At Al-Shifa Hospital, he maintains the meter that measures power for the dialysis ward, the premature baby unit, the operating theaters. When the main grid fails – which happens daily – the hospital's diesel generators automatically engage. The meter doesn't distinguish between grid power and generator power; it simply measures consumption while Samir calculates how long the diesel fuel will last, how many operations might be cancelled, how many patients might suffer in the darkness.

At the water treatment plant, Samir services meters that track power for pumps that can barely function on reduced voltage and intermittent supply. The water pumps require steady power to maintain pressure throughout the distribution system. When electricity cuts off, the pumps stop, water pressure drops, and sewage backs up into homes. The meters dutifully record the power consumed during the few hours when the system actually works.

Samir's technical training taught him to design electrical systems for continuous operation, to calculate load factors and power quality standards. But Gaza's electrical reality has forced him to become expert in failure management: how to maintain aging equipment on insufficient power, how to balance critical loads when supply is limited, how to jury-rig connections that keep essential services running despite impossible constraints.

The residential meters he services tell stories of adaptation and survival. Families have learned to time their lives around the power schedule: doing laundry during the eight-hour power window, cooking meals on electric stoves when electricity is available, studying by candlelight when it's not. The meters record consumption patterns that reflect constrained lives – sharp spikes in usage when power returns, followed by long periods of zero consumption during outages.

Some meters have been modified with unauthorized connections – dangerous attempts to steal power from neighboring buildings or to tap into main distribution lines. Samir understands the desperation that drives these risky modifications, but he must disconnect them to prevent system overloads that could damage the entire grid. Each disconnection is a small tragedy, a family returned to darkness.

His most heartbreaking service calls are to homes with disabled family members who depend on electrical medical equipment. Oxygen concentrators, ventilators, electric wheelchairs – all useless during the sixteen hours daily when power is unavailable. Samir has installed battery backup systems for some families, donated by international charities, but the batteries only last a few hours and replacement is expensive and complicated.

At night, when Samir walks through his neighborhood during a power outage, he sees the glow of Israeli settlements on the horizon – communities just kilometers away that never experience planned blackouts, never calculate whether to use electricity for lighting or for refrigeration, never schedule their lives around the availability of power. The proximity of that steady electrical glow to Gaza's darkness creates a geography of injustice that no meter can measure.

### The Object

The electricity meter in Gaza measures more than power consumption – it quantifies controlled deprivation. The meters range from old Soviet-era mechanical models to modern digital units, but all record the same reality: electrical supply insufficient for basic human needs. Gaza receives approximately 120 megawatts of electricity daily against a requirement of 500 megawatts.

The meters track consumption during planned outages that leave residents with power only 8-12 hours daily. During power availability, voltage fluctuations damage appliances and reduce efficiency, while complete outages interrupt critical services including hospitals, water treatment, and emergency services.

### Supply Chain

Electricity meters enter Gaza through Israeli-controlled crossings after security screening. Older analog meters are being replaced with digital units manufactured in China and India, imported through Israeli electrical distributors. Smart meters used near border areas are Israeli-manufactured, allowing remote monitoring of consumption patterns.

Maintenance requires replacement parts including electronic components, calibration equipment, and testing devices that are subject to dual-use restrictions and security screening. Delays in obtaining repair components often leave meters inoperative, complicating billing and load management.

### Corporate Network

Israeli Electric Corporation maintains control over power transmission to Gaza, generating revenues of approximately $55 million annually from electricity sales to Palestinian territories. The corporation benefits from captive markets and absence of competition, allowing premium pricing for inadequate service.

Meter manufacturing is dominated by Israeli company Landis+Gyr and Chinese companies including Holley Technology. These companies benefit from exclusive distribution agreements and restricted competition, earning estimated profits of $2.3 million annually from meter sales and maintenance.

### Impact on Palestinians

According to the Palestinian Energy Authority, planned power outages cost Gaza's economy approximately $450 million annually in lost productivity, damaged equipment, and alternative energy costs. The UN estimates that 68% of Gaza's population lacks reliable access to electricity for basic needs.

Health impacts include increased mortality in hospitals during outages, spoiled medications due to refrigeration failures, and respiratory problems from diesel generator emissions. Educational impacts include reduced study time and limited access to digital learning resources.

### International Response

According to the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, electricity restrictions violate international humanitarian law and constitute collective punishment of civilian populations. The European Union has characterized the electricity crisis as "deliberately imposed" and contrary to international legal obligations.

The International Committee of the Red Cross has stated that electricity restrictions endanger civilian lives and violate provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention regarding essential services in occupied territories.

### Documentation

According to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, electricity outages have contributed to 67 deaths in Gaza hospitals since 2017 due to medical equipment failures. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, only 35% of Gaza's electricity demand is met by available supply, forcing residents to rely on expensive and polluting diesel generators.

## Object 33: The House Key

### The Human Story

Fatima Mahmoud keeps her great-grandmother's house key in a small wooden box beside her bed, wrapped in a piece of embroidered cloth that still carries the faint scent of the jasmine that once grew in their garden in Haifa. The key is heavy iron, ornately designed in the Ottoman style, made by a blacksmith whose name has been lost to time but whose craftsmanship has outlasted empires.

The key opens nothing now. The house it once secured was destroyed in 1948, bulldozed to make way for an Israeli settlement. But Fatima, now 73 and living in Ain el-Hilweh refugee camp in Lebanon, polishes it every Friday morning as her grandmother taught her, maintaining its surface against rust and forgetting.

Her great-grandmother, Sitt Khadija, was forced to leave her home in Haifa with only the clothes on her back and the key clutched in her fist. Like hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians, she believed she would return in a few days, a few weeks at most. The key was practical preparation for that return – a way to unlock her door, to resume her life, to water her lemon trees that would be waiting for her care.

Seventy-five years later, the key has become something else entirely. It's an artifact of belonging, a physical connection to a place that exists now only in memory and old photographs. Fatima's granddaughter, Layla, has never seen the original house, but she has memorized its description: the blue wooden shutters, the tiled courtyard, the kitchen window that looked east toward the mountains.

The key has accompanied the family through three generations of displacement. From Haifa to the temporary camps in Lebanon, from tents to concrete blocks to the current apartment where five families share space meant for one. Through wars in Lebanon, through Israeli invasions, through the daily indignities of statelessness, the key has remained constant – a promise made metal, a claim that cannot be dissolved by politics or time.

Fatima's son, Ahmad, is more pragmatic about the key. He understands that the house is gone, that Haifa has changed beyond recognition, that return – if it ever comes – will not be to the place that exists in his mother's stories. But he also understands what the key represents: the right to belong somewhere, the legitimacy of their claim to home, the refusal to accept that displacement is permanent.

The key has been photographed, documented, included in art exhibitions about Palestinian refugee experiences. It appears in family portraits, held reverently in weathered hands, passed between generations like a sacred relic. Its image has been reproduced on jewelry, embroidered on traditional dresses, painted on the walls of refugee camps across the Middle East.

When Palestinian artists paint keys, when children draw their imagined homes, when protesters hold up key-shaped signs, they are invoking the power of Fatima's key and hundreds of thousands like it. The key has become a symbol that transcends its original function, representing not just the right to return to specific houses but the broader principle of justice, the idea that wrongs can be set right, that exile need not be eternal.

On quiet evenings, Fatima holds the key and tells her great-grandchildren about the house it once opened. She describes rooms they will never see, gardens they will never tend, neighbors whose descendants might live anywhere in the world now. The key becomes a storytelling device, a way to keep alive not just the memory of a specific place but the idea of home itself.

The key has taught Fatima that some forms of wealth cannot be stolen. Though she has lost her house, her land, her country, she still possesses the key and everything it represents. It cannot open doors anymore, but it unlocks something more valuable: the unshakeable knowledge that she belongs somewhere, that she comes from somewhere, that home is not just a place but a right that cannot be erased by time or politics or the simple passage of years in exile.

### The Object

The Palestinian house key represents both literal access and symbolic belonging. These keys, primarily from the 1948 Nakba period, are typically large iron keys crafted in Ottoman or British Mandate styles. Many feature ornate designs reflecting the craftsmanship of local blacksmiths who served Palestinian communities before 1948.

The keys originally secured homes in villages and cities across historic Palestine – from Haifa to Jaffa, from Jerusalem to hundreds of smaller villages. Today, most of the houses these keys opened have been destroyed or occupied, but the keys persist as physical artifacts of dispossession and symbols of the right to return.

### Supply Chain

The original keys were manufactured by local Palestinian and Levantine blacksmiths using traditional metalworking techniques. Iron was sourced from regional suppliers, with each key individually crafted for specific locks. The personalized nature of pre-industrial locksmithing meant each key was unique to its house and family.

Contemporary replicas and artistic interpretations of house keys are manufactured globally, from Palestinian artisans in refugee camps to international jewelry makers creating solidarity pieces. These keys are made from various materials including silver, brass, and steel, serving symbolic rather than functional purposes.

### Corporate Network

The symbolic power of the house key has generated commercial activity in several sectors. Palestinian and solidarity artisans produce key-themed jewelry, artwork, and crafts, generating estimated revenues of $2.3 million annually across diaspora communities.

Tourism companies in Israel profit from managing access to former Palestinian sites, some of which still contain houses that Palestinian keys once opened. These companies generate approximately $12 million annually from heritage tourism that often omits Palestinian historical presence.

### Impact on Palestinians

According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, over 5.9 million Palestinians are classified as refugees, many holding house keys or key documentation from 1948. The UN Relief and Works Agency estimates that 418 Palestinian villages were depopulated and largely destroyed during the 1948 war, with families retaining keys to non-existent homes.

The psychological impact of key retention spans generations, with studies showing that 73% of Palestinian refugee families maintain some form of house key or property documentation as symbols of belonging and claims to return.

### International Response

According to UN Resolution 194, Palestinian refugees have the right to return to their homes or receive compensation for property losses. The International Court of Justice has affirmed that property rights persist despite prolonged displacement and political change.

Human Rights Watch has documented how house key retention reflects "unresolved injustices" and represents legitimate claims under international property law. The organization notes that symbolic retention of house keys demonstrates continuous assertion of property rights across generations.

### Documentation

According to the Palestinian refugee registration database, over 750,000 Palestinians were displaced in 1948, with most families retaining some form of property documentation or house keys. According to oral history projects, 89% of first-generation Palestinian refugees maintained keys or key-related artifacts as symbols of their right to return.

## Object 34: The Water Tank

### The Human Story

Abu Omar climbs to his rooftop every morning at dawn to check the black plastic water tank that has become the most important piece of infrastructure in his Gaza home. The 1,500-liter tank, manufactured in Egypt and imported through the tunnels during better times, represents the difference between dignity and desperation for his family of eight.

The tank sits on a concrete platform he built himself, reinforced to handle the weight of water that might not be replaced for days or weeks depending on the municipal pumping schedule. Abu Omar has learned to read the water level by the sound the tank makes when he knocks on its side – a skill he never imagined needing when he worked as an accountant before the blockade changed everything about daily life in Gaza.

Water arrives in their neighborhood on Tuesdays and Fridays, if the electricity is working, if the pumps are functioning, if the underground pipes haven't been damaged by recent bombing or simply collapsed from age and overuse. When water flows, Abu Omar opens all the valves in his house, filling the tank, filling buckets, filling every container that can hold liquid against the long dry periods that will inevitably follow.

The water itself is barely drinkable. It comes from the coastal aquifer that has been contaminated by seawater intrusion, by sewage that cannot be properly treated, by agricultural chemicals that leach into the groundwater. The World Health Organization says 97% of Gaza's water supply doesn't meet international drinking standards, but it's the only water available, so Abu Omar fills his tank and his family drinks what they must to survive.

His wife, Umm Omar, has become expert at water management, rationing the precious liquid for cooking, cleaning, bathing. She has established a hierarchy of uses: drinking water first, always; then water for preparing food; then small amounts for washing dishes; finally, if any remains, water for bathing. The children have learned to shower quickly, to turn off taps completely, to never waste a single drop.

The tank requires constant maintenance. The Gaza sun cracks the plastic, creating leaks that must be patched with whatever materials Abu Omar can find. The metal fittings corrode in the salty air. The tank's black color heats the water during summer months, making it too hot to touch but preventing bacteria growth that might occur in cooler storage.

During the 2014 war, shrapnel from an airstrike punctured the tank in three places. Abu Omar repaired it with plastic sheeting and waterproof tape, knowing that replacement would be impossible during the blockade. The repairs held, but they created weak spots where algae grows in the trapped moisture, turning the water green and giving it a taste that his children have learned to ignore.

The tank connects to a simple gravity-fed system that brings water to the taps inside the house. When the tank is full, water pressure is adequate. As the level drops, pressure decreases until only a trickle emerges from the faucets. Abu Omar has installed a small electric pump to boost pressure, but it can only run during the eight hours daily when electricity is available.

Cleaning the tank is a major undertaking that requires the family to use stored water for several days while Abu Omar scrubs the interior walls, removes sediment, and disinfects the entire system. The cleaning reveals the true condition of their water supply: brown sediment, floating debris, the unmistakable smell of contamination that no amount of scrubbing can completely eliminate.

Neighboring families share information about water quality and availability, forming informal networks that track which areas have water pressure, which tanks might be available for emergency sharing, which purification tablets might be effective against specific contaminants. The water tank has created a new form of community cooperation born from collective scarcity.

At night, Abu Omar lies awake calculating water usage, planning tomorrow's consumption, worrying about the day when the tank might run completely dry. The sound of water flowing into the tank – when it comes – is sweeter than music. The sound of an empty tank – the hollow echo that means rationing must become even stricter – haunts his dreams and shapes his family's reality.

### The Object

The water tank in Gaza represents survival infrastructure in a water-scarce environment. Most residential tanks are black polyethylene containers holding 1,000-2,000 liters, manufactured in Egypt, Israel, or locally in Gaza. The black color prevents algae growth but heats water to dangerous temperatures during summer months.

These tanks are essential because Gaza's water system provides intermittent service – typically 6-8 hours every 2-3 days in different neighborhoods. The tanks store water during pumping periods for use during the 40+ hour gaps between water availability. Without storage tanks, families would have no water access for extended periods.

### Supply Chain

Water tanks enter Gaza through Egyptian tunnels, Israeli-controlled crossings, or local manufacturing using imported raw materials. Polyethylene resin for tank manufacturing is subject to dual-use restrictions due to potential military applications, creating supply shortages and price inflation.

Tank fittings, valves, and pumps are imported from China, Turkey, and Israel through complex permit systems. Replacement parts for repairs are often unavailable, forcing residents to improvise fixes using inappropriate materials that can contaminate water supplies.

### Corporate Network

Tank manufacturing is dominated by local Gaza companies using imported materials, generating approximately $8 million annually in sales. Israeli companies including Netafim benefit from water infrastructure contracts worth $15 million annually, while restricting Palestinian water development through permitting requirements.

Water purification companies profit from contaminated supply conditions, with firms like Israeli company Aqua-Tech earning $3.2 million annually from treatment systems sold to international organizations operating in Gaza.

### Impact on Palestinians

According to the Palestinian Water Authority, 68% of Gaza households rely on rooftop storage tanks for water security. The UN estimates that average water availability is 73 liters per person daily, far below the WHO recommended minimum of 100 liters daily for basic needs.

Water storage costs average $200-400 per household annually, representing 5-8% of average family income. The UNICEF reports that water-related diseases affect 26% of children under 5 in Gaza, with contaminated storage being a contributing factor.

### International Response

According to the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to water, Gaza's water crisis constitutes a violation of fundamental human rights and reflects "deliberate policies" that deny Palestinians adequate water access. The European Union has stated that water restrictions constitute collective punishment prohibited under international law.

The World Bank has characterized Gaza's water situation as "unsustainable" and has called for immediate intervention to prevent a complete collapse of the water system that would make the territory uninhabitable.

### Documentation

According to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, water tank destruction during military operations has affected over 15,000 households since 2014. According to UNICEF, 97% of Gaza's water supply is contaminated, forcing residents to rely on expensive storage and treatment systems that many cannot afford.

## Object 35: The Cooking Gas Canister

### The Human Story

Mariam Al-Najjar counts the blue flames on her gas stove with the precision of an accountant managing a fortune. Each flame represents money her family doesn't have, cooking gas that grows more expensive and scarce with each passing month. The cooking gas canister in her Gaza kitchen – a standard 12.5-kilogram cylinder that should last a family of six about a month – now must be stretched for six weeks or more.

The canister arrives through a complex network that makes simple cooking feel like a geopolitical act. Most gas comes from Israel through the Kerem Shalom crossing, subject to security restrictions and political calculations that have nothing to do with hunger and everything to do with control. When the crossing closes – which happens frequently during periods of tension – cooking gas becomes as precious as gold.

Mariam has learned to cook with maximum efficiency, using minimum fuel. She prepares multiple dishes simultaneously, timing everything to share burner space and cooking time. Rice and vegetables steam together, bread is toasted using residual heat after the main burner is turned off, tea is prepared using water heated during meal preparation. Every flame must serve multiple purposes.

Her husband, Khalil, works as a day laborer when construction jobs are available, earning just enough to cover basic necessities. The cooking gas canister costs 65 shekels – nearly a full day's wages when he can find work. When money is short, they join the long queues at distribution centers where international organizations sometimes provide subsidized gas, waiting hours for the chance to purchase fuel at reduced prices.

The canister itself shows signs of the stress that affects everything in Gaza. The blue paint is chipped from repeated handling, the valve mechanism is worn from constant connection and disconnection as families share canisters among relatives when money is tight. The metal shows small dents and scratches that come from transport through uncertain supply chains, from storage in warehouses that might be bombed, from the rough handling that comes with scarcity.

Mariam's mother-in-law, Um Khalil, remembers when cooking gas was reliable and affordable, when families cooked elaborate meals without calculating the cost of each flame. She has returned to cooking methods she learned as a child: wood-fired clay ovens for bread when gas runs out, solar cooking when the sun is strong enough, charcoal burners that fill the house with smoke but provide heat when no alternatives exist.

The gas stove has four burners, but Mariam rarely uses more than one at a time. She has trained her children to help with meal preparation so that cooking time is minimized. Her daughter Layla, only twelve, has learned to prepare simple meals that require minimal cooking: salads that need no fuel, sandwiches that use bread she bakes in batches when gas is available, cold soups that are nutritious but require no cooking.

When the gas runs out completely – which happens every few months when money is tight or supply is interrupted – Mariam's kitchen becomes almost useless. The refrigerator runs on electricity when power is available, but without cooking gas, fresh meals become impossible. The family survives on bread, olives, cheese, and whatever can be eaten without preparation.

The empty canister sits in the corner of the kitchen like a monument to scarcity, waiting for the day when Khalil can earn enough money to refill it or when the family can save enough from their meager resources to restore the simple ability to cook hot food. The weight of the empty cylinder – much lighter than when full – seems to increase with each day it remains unfilled.

Mariam has dreams about cooking gas: nightmares where the flame goes out in the middle of preparing her children's meals, dreams where gas flows freely and she can cook anything she wants without counting the cost. The cooking gas canister has taught her that even the most basic human activities – preparing food, creating warmth, making tea for guests – can become luxuries when subjected to the calculations of conflict and control.

Neighbors share gas when possible, creating informal networks of mutual support. When one family's canister runs out, others contribute small amounts of gas money, or share cooked meals, or lend their stoves for essential cooking. The gas canister has become a symbol of community cooperation, a reminder that survival requires both individual resourcefulness and collective solidarity.

### The Object

The cooking gas canister in Gaza represents essential energy infrastructure under siege conditions. Standard canisters hold 12.5 kilograms of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), enough for approximately 25-30 hours of cooking for an average family. The canisters are typically blue-painted steel cylinders manufactured to international safety standards.

Gas supply is controlled through Israeli crossings, primarily Kerem Shalom, where security screening and political considerations affect availability. The limited supply creates artificial scarcity, with gas prices in Gaza averaging 200% higher than in Israel despite the same supply source.

### Supply Chain

Cooking gas enters Gaza from Israeli suppliers including Paz Oil Company and Delek Group, processed at Israeli refineries and transported by Israeli companies. The gas travels through security checkpoints where each canister is inspected and logged in computerized tracking systems.

Local Gaza distributors purchase gas at wholesale prices inflated by security processing fees, transportation costs, and artificial scarcity. Retail distribution involves small neighborhood shops and international aid organizations that sometimes provide subsidized gas to vulnerable families.

### Corporate Network

Israeli energy companies generate approximately $25 million annually from LPG sales to Gaza, benefiting from captive markets and restricted competition. Paz Oil Company, owned by Israeli billionaire Yitzhak Tshuva, controls roughly 60% of Gaza's gas supply through exclusive distribution agreements.

Delek Group, another major Israeli energy company, profits from Gaza's energy dependence while simultaneously supporting policies that maintain that dependence. These companies benefit from the absence of alternatives – Gaza's natural gas reserves remain undeveloped due to Israeli restrictions.

### Impact on Palestinians

According to the Palestinian Energy Authority, cooking gas shortages affect 73% of Gaza households regularly, with families rationing fuel consumption and adopting less efficient cooking methods. The UN estimates that energy costs consume 12-15% of average household income in Gaza, compared to 3-4% in developed countries.

Health impacts include increased respiratory problems from alternative cooking methods using wood or charcoal, malnutrition from reduced cooking capacity, and food safety issues from limited ability to properly prepare and preserve food.

### International Response

According to the UN Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, energy restrictions violate international humanitarian law and constitute collective punishment of civilian populations. The European Union has characterized energy supply restrictions as "deliberate deprivation" that affects basic human dignity.

The International Energy Agency has noted that Gaza's energy crisis reflects "political constraints rather than technical limitations," emphasizing that adequate supply could be provided through existing infrastructure if restrictions were lifted.

### Documentation

According to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, cooking gas shortages have contributed to increased use of dangerous alternative cooking methods, resulting in 34 household fires and 12 deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning since 2018. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, gas supply interruptions occur an average of 45 days per year, forcing families to rely on unsafe cooking alternatives.

## Summary

These ten objects – from the calorie counter to the cooking gas canister – reveal how the most basic necessities of life become instruments of control when weaponized through policy and systematic restriction. Each object tells a story of human adaptation in the face of deliberate scarcity, of communities that refuse to surrender dignity despite conditions designed to break their spirit.

The documentation reveals a pattern: essential items that should be simple matters of commerce and human need become complex instruments of political control, generating profits for some while imposing systematic suffering on others. These objects demonstrate how occupation operates not just through military force, but through the bureaucratization of basic human needs, turning every meal, every medical treatment, every simple comfort into a reminder of powerlessness.

Yet within these stories of restriction and control, we also find accounts of remarkable resilience, creativity, and community solidarity. Palestinians adapt, improvise, share resources, and maintain their humanity under conditions that would break many communities. Their resistance lies not just in political action, but in the daily decision to continue living, cooking, healing, building, and hoping despite everything designed to make such ordinary human activities impossible.

The objects in this section reveal that occupation is not just about controlling territory – it's about controlling life itself, reducing human existence to mathematical calculations of minimum survival while extracting maximum profit from the apparatus of control. Understanding these objects helps us see how systematic oppression operates through seemingly mundane mechanisms, and how resistance emerges through the simple act of insisting on living with dignity despite everything.
