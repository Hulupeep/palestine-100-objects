# Objects 51-58: Part III - Objects of Sumud/Steadfastness

## Object 51: The Olive Tree Sapling (Agricultural Resistance)

In the early morning light of a spring day in 2019, Fatima Qasemi knelt beside a small hole she had dug in the rocky soil of her family's land near Ramallah. In her weathered hands, she held a delicate olive tree sapling, its tender leaves catching the golden sunlight. This was not just any tree—it was grown from a pit saved from olives harvested from a 400-year-old tree that Israeli bulldozers had uprooted the previous year.

"Every tree we plant is a declaration," Fatima whispered to her eight-year-old granddaughter, Layla, who watched with wide, curious eyes. "We are saying to the world: we are still here, we are still rooted, we will still grow."

The sapling represented more than agricultural defiance—it was a living symbol of sumud, the Palestinian concept of steadfast perseverance. Fatima's family had been planting olive trees for seven generations, each tree a thread in the fabric of their connection to the land. The Israeli occupation had uprooted thousands of these ancient witnesses, but for every tree destroyed, Palestinian families planted two more.

As Fatima gently placed the sapling in the earth, she remembered her grandfather's words: "The olive tree teaches us patience, child. It grows slowly, lives long, and gives abundantly. Like our people, it survives the harshest conditions and still bears fruit."

The planting was both ritual and rebellion. Around her, other families were doing the same—a coordinated act of agricultural resistance that transformed the landscape into a living testament of Palestinian presence. Each sapling was carefully tended with precious water, protected from settlers' goats, and guarded against military raids.

Layla helped pack the soil around the delicate roots, her small hands working beside her grandmother's experienced ones. "Will I see it give olives, Teta?" she asked.

"Inshallah, my dear. And your children will harvest from it, and their children after them. This tree will outlive us all, carrying our story in its branches."

The olive tree sapling embodies the Palestinian strategy of "presence" over "protest"—the quiet, persistent assertion of belonging through cultivation and care. In a context where existence itself is resistance, every planted tree becomes an act of hope, a commitment to the future, and a refusal to be erased.

Years later, when that sapling had grown tall enough to provide shade, Layla would bring her own children to sit beneath its branches, continuing the cycle of connection, care, and cultural transmission that no occupation could break.

## Object 52: The Traditional Dress/Thobe (Cultural Preservation)

The thobe hung carefully in Amira Mansour's wardrobe, its deep blue fabric adorned with intricate red and gold embroidery that told the story of her village, her family, and her identity. Each stitch was a word in the visual language of Palestinian heritage, each pattern a chapter in the book of her people's history.

It was 2018, and Amira was preparing her eighteen-year-old daughter, Nour, for her high school graduation ceremony. In a world where Palestinian identity was constantly under threat of erasure, wearing the traditional thobe had become an act of cultural resistance, a way of making the invisible visible.

"This thobe belonged to your great-grandmother," Amira explained as she helped Nour into the garment. "She embroidered it herself when she was young, living in Haifa before 1948. Every thread carries her dreams, her skills, her connection to the land."

The embroidery patterns were not merely decorative—they were a sophisticated communication system. The cypress trees stitched along the chest represented eternal life and steadfastness. The geometric patterns on the sleeves indicated which village the wearer came from, while the colors told of her family's status and region. Red threads symbolized joy and celebration, while the deep blue background represented the Palestinian sky and sea.

As Nour looked at herself in the mirror, she saw not just a dress but a living museum, a portable homeland that traveled with her wherever she went. In the Palestinian diaspora, these garments had become particularly precious—tangible links to a homeland many had never seen or could not visit.

"In refugee camps across the region, women gathered to teach young girls the traditional embroidery patterns," Amira continued, her fingers tracing the delicate stitchwork. "They knew that even if they lost everything else, these skills, these patterns, these stories could survive in their daughters' hands."

The thobe had evolved with the times while maintaining its cultural essence. Contemporary Palestinian designers incorporated traditional motifs into modern clothing, creating a bridge between past and present. Young Palestinian women wore keffiyeh-patterned scarves and embroidered jackets to university, carrying their heritage into cosmopolitan spaces.

At the graduation ceremony, Nour stood proudly among her classmates, her thobe making a statement that was both personal and political. She was not just a graduate—she was a keeper of culture, a living repository of traditions that had survived exile, occupation, and displacement.

The photographs from that day would join the family album, another generation documented in traditional dress, another link added to the unbroken chain of cultural preservation. In wearing the thobe, Nour had participated in the Palestinian act of sumud—the steadfast refusal to disappear, to be assimilated, or to forget who she was and where she came from.

## Object 53: The Prayer Beads/Misbaha (Spiritual Resilience)

Abu Ahmad's fingers moved automatically across the smooth wooden beads of his misbaha as he sat in the shade of his home in the Dheisheh refugee camp near Bethlehem. The prayer beads had belonged to his father, and his father's father before him—a tactile connection to generations of faith that had sustained the family through seven decades of displacement.

Each bead was worn smooth by countless hours of contemplation, prayer, and quiet meditation. The misbaha was more than a religious tool—it was a source of comfort, a focus for anxiety, and a physical reminder of spiritual resilience in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges.

"La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah" (There is no power except in God), Abu Ahmad murmured quietly as his thumb and forefinger rolled each bead. The rhythmic motion had a meditative quality that helped him process the daily stresses of life under occupation—the checkpoints, the permit denials, the economic uncertainty that defined Palestinian existence.

His grandson, fifteen-year-old Khalil, sat beside him, working on homework despite the camp's overcrowded conditions and intermittent electricity. The boy had grown up watching his grandfather's quiet ritual, understanding without being told that the prayer beads represented something essential about their family's identity.

"Jiddo, why do you always carry those beads?" Khalil asked one evening, looking up from his mathematics problems.

Abu Ahmad smiled, holding up the misbaha so the lamp light caught the grain of the olive wood. "These beads taught me patience, my son. Each one represents a moment of surrender to God's will, a moment of finding peace despite our circumstances."

The misbaha had traveled with Abu Ahmad's family from their original village near Jerusalem in 1948, one of the few possessions they managed to carry during the Nakba. It had provided comfort during the difficult early years in the refugee camp, when families lived in tents and uncertainty about the future seemed endless.

Over the decades, the prayer beads had witnessed countless family moments—births, deaths, celebrations, and sorrows. They had been present during late-night vigils when sons were imprisoned, during celebrations when daughters graduated from university despite all obstacles, during prayers for peace that seemed perpetually deferred.

The spiritual practice represented by the misbaha was not passive resignation but active resilience. It taught believers to find strength in faith, to maintain dignity in difficult circumstances, and to trust in a larger plan even when immediate justice seemed absent.

In the Palestinian context, spirituality had always been deeply intertwined with resistance and survival. The call to prayer echoing across refugee camps reminded residents of their deeper identity beyond displacement. Religious festivals and practices provided structure and meaning in environments designed to dehumanize and dispirit.

As Abu Ahmad grew older, he began teaching Khalil the prayers associated with the beads, passing down not just the physical object but the spiritual practices that had sustained their family for generations. The misbaha would eventually pass to the boy, carrying with it the accumulated prayers, hopes, and faith of his ancestors.

## Object 54: The Embroidery Thread (Economic Empowerment)

In the cramped living room of a refugee camp house in Jordan, Umm Naser guided the needle through the cream-colored fabric with practiced precision, the red embroidery thread creating intricate patterns that had been passed down through generations. Around her, four other women worked on similar pieces, their conversation flowing as naturally as their needlework.

This was more than a social gathering—it was a cooperative business venture that had grown from necessity into empowerment. The Palestinian Women's Embroidery Collective had started five years earlier when Umm Naser realized that the traditional skills the women possessed could become a source of income for families struggling with unemployment and displacement.

"Each piece tells our story," she explained to Sarah, a young Palestinian-American who had come to document their work. "The thread carries our history, our skills, our dreams for economic independence."

The embroidery collective represented a distinctly Palestinian approach to economic resistance. In a context where traditional employment was often limited by refugee status, visa restrictions, or occupation policies, Palestinian women had turned to their cultural heritage as a source of economic power.

The threads themselves were carefully chosen—premium cotton in traditional colors that had been used for centuries in Palestinian embroidery. The red represented the poppy flowers that bloomed in Palestinian fields, the deep blue reflected the Mediterranean sky, and the gold threads caught light like the Jerusalem sunset.

Each woman specialized in different patterns and techniques passed down through their families. Umm Naser was known for her geometric borders that indicated her family's origin in the Jerusalem area. Umm Khalil excelled at the cypress tree motifs traditional to the Ramallah region, while Umm Samir created the intricate floral patterns typical of coastal Palestinian villages.

The finished pieces—cushions, wall hangings, traditional dresses, and contemporary accessories—were sold through online platforms to customers around the world. Palestinian diaspora communities particularly treasured these handmade items as connections to their heritage, while international customers appreciated the beauty and craftsmanship of each piece.

"When someone buys our embroidery, they're not just purchasing decoration," Umm Naser explained as she worked on a complex pattern. "They're supporting Palestinian women, preserving Palestinian culture, and investing in our community's future."

The economic impact extended beyond the immediate participants. The cooperative purchased materials from local suppliers, employed younger women to help with finishing and packaging, and reinvested profits into training programs that taught traditional techniques to the next generation.

The embroidery thread also represented the adaptation of tradition to modern circumstances. While maintaining authentic patterns and techniques, the women had expanded their production to include items that appealed to contemporary tastes—phone cases with traditional motifs, modern jackets with embroidered details, and artistic pieces suitable for international exhibition.

For Umm Naser and her colleagues, each thread pulled through fabric was an act of resistance against economic marginalization, cultural erasure, and gender discrimination. Their needles were tools of empowerment, their threads connections to both past and future, their finished pieces testimonies to Palestinian creativity and resilience.

## Object 55: The Oud (Musical Heritage)

The oud's wooden body gleamed under the stage lights as Rasheed Khalil tuned the ancient instrument in the cultural center in Ramallah. Tonight's concert would celebrate Palestinian musical heritage, and the oud—with its deep, resonant voice and centuries-old traditions—would serve as the evening's emotional centerpiece.

Rasheed's fingers moved across the eleven strings with the familiarity of decades of practice. His grandfather had played the same instrument, entertaining wedding parties and community gatherings in their village near Jaffa before 1948. When the family was forced to flee during the Nakba, the oud was one of the few possessions they managed to carry.

"Music travels light," his grandfather had said during those difficult early years of displacement. "Soldiers can confiscate our land, but they cannot confiscate a melody. They can destroy our homes, but they cannot destroy a song that lives in the heart."

The oud represented the sophisticated musical traditions that had flourished in Palestine for centuries. Its complex tuning system and intricate playing techniques required years to master, connecting contemporary musicians to generations of masters who had developed and refined the art form. Each region had its own musical styles and repertoire, from the maqam traditions of Jerusalem to the folk songs of Galilee villages.

As Rasheed began the evening's first piece—a haunting melody called "Ala Dal Ouna" (Oh, Our Injustice)—the audience fell silent, transported by the instrument's expressive range. The oud could whisper like wind through olive trees or cry like a mother mourning her lost children. Its voice carried the full emotional spectrum of Palestinian experience.

The musical tradition had adapted remarkably to displacement and diaspora. Palestinian musicians around the world had incorporated local influences while maintaining the essential character of their heritage music. In refugee camps, young people learned traditional songs that kept alive the memory of villages they had never seen. In the diaspora, Palestinian cultural centers organized oud lessons and musical ensembles that provided identity anchors for subsequent generations.

"This instrument teaches us about our culture's sophistication," Rasheed explained to the young students who gathered around him after the performance. "Palestinian music is not primitive or simple—it is complex, nuanced, and deeply emotional. When the world tries to reduce us to political categories, our music reminds them of our humanity."

The oud had also become a vehicle for contemporary artistic expression. Young Palestinian musicians composed new pieces that reflected current realities while drawing on traditional forms. Hip-hop artists sampled classical oud melodies, creating fusion works that spoke to Palestinian youth navigating modern urban environments while maintaining connections to their heritage.

In the context of cultural preservation, learning to play the oud was an act of resistance against erasure. Each student who mastered the instrument became a keeper of tradition, capable of transmitting both techniques and repertoire to future generations. Music schools and cultural organizations prioritized oud instruction, understanding its role in maintaining Palestinian cultural identity.

As the evening concluded, Rasheed carefully placed the instrument in its protective case, but its melodies continued to resonate in the hearts of everyone who had listened. The oud's voice had reminded them that Palestinian culture was not just about survival—it was about beauty, sophistication, and the enduring human capacity to create art that touches the soul.

## Object 56: The Bread Oven/Taboun (Food Sovereignty)

The clay taboun oven radiated warmth in the courtyard behind Sitt Mariam's house in the village of Bil'in, near Ramallah. Early morning smoke rose from its dome-shaped structure as she prepared the day's bread, continuing a tradition that connected her family to centuries of Palestinian culinary heritage.

The taboun was more than a cooking implement—it was the heart of community life, a symbol of self-sufficiency, and a powerful assertion of Palestinian food sovereignty. Built from local clay and fired with wood from olive trees, it represented the deep connection between Palestinian identity and the land that sustained their ancestors.

"Bread made in the taboun tastes different from any other bread," Sitt Mariam explained to her daughter-in-law, Reem, who was learning the intricate process of traditional baking. "It tastes like home, like history, like the earth itself."

The preparation began before dawn. Sitt Mariam mixed flour, water, salt, and yeast by hand, feeling for the right consistency that could only be learned through experience. The dough was kneaded with prayers and patience, then left to rise while she prepared the oven. Building the fire required skill—the right combination of wood size and placement to create the intense, even heat necessary for perfect bread.

The taboun technique had been refined over generations of Palestinian women who understood that food was never just about nutrition—it was about culture, community, and resistance. In a context where Palestinian agricultural land was constantly under threat, where movement restrictions limited access to markets, and where economic pressure made food security precarious, the ability to bake bread in a traditional oven represented profound autonomy.

Neighbors began arriving as the first loaves emerged from the oven, their crusts golden and crackling. The bread would be shared—some for each family, some for elderly neighbors who could no longer bake for themselves, some set aside for unexpected guests. This distribution network represented the social solidarity that had enabled Palestinian communities to survive decades of hardship.

"The Israelis can control our water, limit our movement, restrict our trade," Sitt Mariam said as she pulled another perfectly baked loaf from the oven. "But as long as we have wheat, we have independence. As long as we have the taboun, we have dignity."

The traditional oven also served as a teaching tool for younger generations. Children learned by watching, helping, and gradually taking on more responsibility. They understood that baking bread was not just a chore but a skill that connected them to their heritage and provided security in uncertain times.

The taboun had adapted to modern circumstances while maintaining its essential character. Some families had modified the design for urban settings, creating smaller versions suitable for apartment courtyards. Palestinian restaurants around the world featured taboun ovens as both cooking tools and cultural statements, demonstrating authentic culinary traditions to international audiences.

In the broader context of Palestinian resistance, food sovereignty represented a crucial dimension of sumud. Traditional cooking methods, indigenous seeds, and local food systems were all elements of maintaining cultural autonomy. The taboun oven embodied this philosophy—it was powered by local materials, operated with traditional knowledge, and produced food that nourished both body and cultural identity.

As the morning's baking concluded, Sitt Mariam banked the coals for the next day's fire. The taboun would continue its daily service, turning simple ingredients into sustenance, transforming individual effort into community sharing, and proving that some forms of resistance could be measured in the warmth of fresh bread and the satisfaction of self-reliance.

## Object 57: The Wedding Ring (Love and Continuity)

The simple gold band caught the afternoon light as Nadia Khoury held her grandmother's hand in the hospital room in Ramallah. The ring had been worn for sixty-three years of marriage, through displacement, hardship, and the raising of seven children who had scattered across the globe in search of opportunities denied to them in their homeland.

"This ring witnessed everything," her grandmother, Sitt Widad, whispered, her voice weak but her eyes bright with memory. "It was there when your grandfather and I were married in 1955 in the refugee camp. It was there when we saved every piaster to buy our first real house. It was there when we celebrated your father's graduation, when we mourned your uncle's imprisonment, when we danced at your cousin's wedding last year."

The wedding ring represented more than marital commitment—it embodied the Palestinian determination to build families, maintain traditions, and create joy despite circumstances designed to destroy hope. In the context of displacement, occupation, and diaspora, every Palestinian wedding became an act of defiance, every family formed a victory against attempts at demographic manipulation and cultural erasure.

Nadia remembered her own wedding three years earlier, when her fiancé had flown from Germany where he was completing his engineering degree, navigating visa restrictions and travel limitations to marry in the same church where his grandparents had wed. The celebration had lasted three days, with traditional dabke dancing, oud music, and the preparation of dishes whose recipes had been preserved through generations of displacement.

"Love is our resistance," Sitt Widad continued, her fingers turning the worn gold band. "When they destroy our houses, we build new ones. When they separate our families, we find ways to reunite. When they try to make us disappear, we create the next generation."

The ring had traveled from Palestine to Jordan during the 1967 war, when the family was forced to evacuate temporarily. It had returned when conditions stabilized, carrying with it the dreams and prayers of a couple determined to maintain their connection to their homeland despite multiple offers to resettle permanently in other countries.

Palestinian weddings had evolved to incorporate the realities of diaspora while maintaining essential cultural elements. Ceremonies often featured traditional clothing brought from Palestine, music performed by Palestinian musicians, and the preparation of foods that connected celebrants to their culinary heritage. Extended families would travel from across the region or around the world to participate, understanding that each wedding was also a reunion and a renewal of community bonds.

The ring had also witnessed the particular challenges facing Palestinian couples. Young people often had to navigate immigration laws that made it difficult for spouses to live together. Students studying abroad faced decisions about whether to return home or build lives in countries that offered greater opportunities but cultural isolation.

"Your grandfather proposed with this ring knowing we would face difficulties," Sitt Widad said, watching as Nadia's own wedding ring caught the light. "But he also knew that Palestinian love is stronger than any obstacle they could create."

The wedding rings in Palestinian families carried the weight of collective endurance. They represented the refusal to allow political circumstances to prevent the formation of families, the raising of children, and the continuation of cultural traditions. Each Palestinian child born was a victory against demographic manipulation, each wedding celebrated was a declaration of faith in the future.

As Sitt Widad grew tired, Nadia kissed her grandmother's hand, the wedding ring now loose on her finger but still symbolically powerful. That ring would eventually pass to another generation, carrying with it the accumulated love, commitment, and resistance of a family that had refused to let external circumstances define the boundaries of their happiness.

## Object 58: The Family Photo Album (Memory Preservation)

Leila Shaheen carefully turned the pages of the thick photo album, each image a portal to memories that had been curated and preserved with the precision of a historian and the love of a mother. The album sat on the kitchen table of her modest apartment in Ramalleus refugee camp, its pages chronicling seven decades of Palestinian family life through portraits, celebrations, and everyday moments that had taken on profound significance.

"This is your great-grandfather's house in Haifa," she explained to her eight-year-old grandson, Omar, pointing to a black-and-white photograph from 1947. "See the lemon trees in the courtyard? Your great-grandmother used to make the most beautiful lemonade from those trees."

The photo album represented more than family history—it was a form of resistance against erasure, a tangible proof of Palestinian life and culture that predated displacement. Each photograph served as evidence that Palestinian families had not always been refugees, that they had owned homes, cultivated land, and lived ordinary lives in their ancestral homeland.

The early photographs showed a Palestine that many young Palestinians had never seen—bustling city streets, thriving agricultural communities, and families dressed in traditional clothing posed formally for studio portraits. These images contradicted narratives that portrayed Palestine as empty or undeveloped before 1948, providing visual testimony to the sophisticated society that had existed.

"Here's your grandfather's graduation from the Teacher's College in Jerusalem," Leila continued, indicating a proud young man in academic robes standing in front of an imposing stone building. "He taught in village schools for forty years, even after we became refugees. He said education was the one thing they could never take away from us."

The album documented the evolution of Palestinian life through displacement. Wedding photographs showed couples married in refugee camps, their happiness evident despite the temporary structures and difficult conditions surrounding them. Graduation photos celebrated educational achievements attained against enormous odds. Birthday parties and holiday celebrations demonstrated the community's determination to maintain joy and tradition despite circumstances designed to destroy both.

Each photograph had been carefully preserved, with names, dates, and locations written in careful Arabic script on the back. Leila understood that she was not just keeping family memories but serving as an archivist for Palestinian history. These images would help future generations understand their heritage and maintain connections to relatives scattered across the globe by displacement and emigration.

"Why do we have so many pictures of people eating?" Omar asked, noticing the numerous images of family gatherings around elaborate meals.

"Food brings families together," Leila explained, smiling at photographs of holiday feasts and celebration dinners. "When we share meals, we share stories. These pictures help us remember not just what we looked like, but how we lived, what we valued, how we took care of each other."

The photo album had survived multiple displacements, carefully packed and protected during each forced relocation. During the 1967 war, when the family had to evacuate quickly, the album was among the few possessions Leila's mother insisted on carrying. "Houses can be rebuilt," she had said, "but memories, once lost, are gone forever."

In recent years, Leila had begun digitizing the collection, understanding that preservation required adapting to new technologies. She sent copies to relatives living in other countries, creating a shared family archive that connected Palestinian diaspora communities to their common history.

The album also served an educational function for younger family members who had been born in exile. Through these photographs, they could see their grandparents as young people, understand the prosperity and normalcy that had characterized Palestinian life before displacement, and appreciate the resilience that had enabled their family to survive and thrive despite enormous challenges.

As Omar helped turn the pages, examining each photograph with growing curiosity, Leila realized that the album was fulfilling its essential purpose. It was transmitting memory, preserving identity, and ensuring that the next generation would understand not just where they came from, but who they were. The photographs would outlive her, carrying their accumulated stories into a future she might not see but had helped to shape through the simple but profound act of remembering.

*End of Objects 51-58: Part III - Objects of Sumud/Steadfastness*

Each of these objects represents a different dimension of Palestinian sumud—the steadfast determination to preserve identity, maintain culture, and continue building meaningful lives despite systematic attempts at erasure and displacement. From the olive tree sapling's agricultural resistance to the family photo album's memory preservation, these items embody the everyday acts of resilience that sustain Palestinian communities around the world.

The narratives celebrate not just survival but the active creation of beauty, meaning, and joy in circumstances designed to prevent all three. They demonstrate that Palestinian resistance takes many forms—some political, some cultural, some as simple as baking bread in a traditional oven or teaching a child to play the oud.

Together, these eight objects illustrate the multifaceted nature of Palestinian sumud: spiritual resilience through prayer beads, economic empowerment through embroidery cooperatives, cultural preservation through traditional dress and music, food sovereignty through traditional baking, and the fundamental human acts of love and memory that sustain communities across generations and geography.
