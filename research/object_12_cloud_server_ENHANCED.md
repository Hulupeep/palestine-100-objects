# Object 12: The Cloud Server
## Digital Infrastructure of Mass Surveillance: How Microsoft Azure Powers Intelligence Operations Against Palestinian Civilians

### The Human Story

In the bustling refugee camp of Balata near Nablus, Amjad sits quietly in his small apartment, unaware that his evening phone call to his cousin in Gaza has just been automatically intercepted, processed, and stored on servers thousands of miles away in the Netherlands. The conversation—like millions of others from Palestinian families across the occupied territories—will be permanently archived in Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure, available for analysis by Israeli intelligence algorithms designed to identify targets for arrest, detention, or worse.

According to investigations by +972 Magazine and The Guardian published in August 2025, Amjad's voice is now part of what intelligence sources describe as "one of the world's largest and most intrusive collections of surveillance data over a single population group." His call joins approximately 11,500 terabytes of Palestinian communications—equivalent to 200 million hours of audio—stored on Microsoft's cloud servers through a partnership that CEO Satya Nadella personally approved as "critical" for the company.

The technology that makes this possible sits in climate-controlled facilities across Europe, where rows of servers hum quietly while processing the intimate details of Palestinian life. When Amjad calls to check on his elderly father's medication, when his wife coordinates carpools for their children, when he discusses work concerns with colleagues—all of these conversations become data points in a surveillance apparatus that three Israeli intelligence sources admitted has been used to "guide deadly air strikes" and "shape operations across the occupied Palestinian territories."

For Palestinians like Amjad's family, the psychological impact extends beyond the calls themselves. The knowledge that any conversation might be monitored creates what human rights advocates describe as a "chilling effect" on free expression and association. Family members hesitate before discussing political views, activists modify their language when organizing community events, and even routine conversations carry the weight of potential surveillance. As one Israeli intelligence source revealed to investigators: "When they need to arrest someone and there isn't a good enough reason to do so, that's where they find the excuse."

The human cost becomes starkly visible in the data storage statistics: as Israel's war on Gaza continues with over 61,250 Palestinians killed including 18,000 children, the surveillance program remains active, with existing data combined with AI tools continuing to be used in military operations. Each terabyte represents thousands of Palestinian families whose private moments have been transformed into intelligence assets, their voices digitized and catalogued in a system designed not for their protection, but for their control.

### The Object

According to Microsoft's 2024 Form 10-K filing with the SEC, Microsoft Azure represents a core component of the company's Intelligent Cloud segment, which generated over $75 billion in revenue during fiscal year 2024. The Azure infrastructure consists of distributed cloud computing services spanning more than 60 datacenter regions across 140 countries, powered by custom hardware including Azure Maia AI accelerators and Azure Cobalt CPUs.

The technical specifications reveal a surveillance-optimized infrastructure capable of processing massive data volumes. Microsoft's datacenters feature redundant power systems operating at 400-volt DC, enabling up to 35% more processing capacity per rack while supporting dynamic power adjustments for AI workloads. Each facility incorporates Azure Integrated Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and advanced monitoring systems that can automatically collect, analyze, and integrate log data from network resources.

For the Unit 8200 partnership specifically, Microsoft engineers developed what internal documents describe as a "customized and segregated area of Microsoft Azure" that went operational in 2022. This specialized environment provides what one intelligence officer characterized as "infinite storage" capacity, hosted primarily on Microsoft's European infrastructure in the Netherlands (Evert van de Beekstraat 354, Schiphol) and Ireland (New Nangor Road, Dublin), with additional caches in Israel.

### The Human Impact

According to the joint investigation by +972 Magazine, Local Call, and The Guardian, the surveillance system affects the entire Palestinian population in Gaza and the West Bank—approximately 5.3 million people whose communications are subject to mass collection and indefinite storage. Intelligence sources revealed that the system processes "a million calls an hour," creating what human rights organizations describe as the largest per-capita surveillance operation in modern history.

Three Israeli intelligence sources confirmed to investigators that the cloud-based system has been used to "guide deadly air strikes" and "shape operations across the occupied Palestinian territories" over the past two years. The stored communications data serves multiple operational purposes: Unit 8200 sources admitted it is used to "find incriminating material on virtually any Palestinian, facilitating arrests, blackmail, administrative detention, or retroactive justification for killings."

The scale of impact becomes clearer through the technical metrics: 11,500 terabytes of Palestinian communications data stored as of July 2025, representing approximately 200 million hours of audio from intimate family conversations, business discussions, medical consultations, and educational communications. As Israel's military operations in Gaza continue with over 61,250 Palestinian casualties including 18,000 children, intelligence sources confirmed the surveillance data continues to inform military targeting decisions.

### The Supply Chain

Microsoft Corporation's involvement stems from a 2021 agreement between CEO Satya Nadella and Yossi Sariel, former commander of Unit 8200 (2021-2024). According to internal Microsoft documents obtained by The Guardian, Nadella personally defined the partnership as "critical" for Microsoft and committed company resources to support the intelligence operation.

The technical infrastructure relies on Microsoft Azure's European datacenter network, specifically facilities in the Netherlands operated from Schiphol and Ireland's Dublin location. Microsoft engineers, including former Unit 8200 personnel, worked directly with Israeli intelligence to develop specialized cloud architecture with embedded security features facilitating the transfer of up to 70% of Unit 8200's sensitive data to Azure servers.

According to Microsoft's 2024 SEC Form 10-K filing, the company's Azure and cloud services revenue grew 30% year-over-year, with the Intelligent Cloud segment generating $34.1 billion in quarterly revenue. While specific contract values for the Unit 8200 partnership remain undisclosed, internal Microsoft documents described the relationship as "an incredibly powerful brand moment" for Azure and a "lucrative business opportunity."

### The Corporate Network

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) reported total revenue of $245 billion for fiscal year 2024 according to its Form 10-K filing dated July 30, 2024. The company's three largest institutional shareholders according to 2024 13F-HR SEC filings are:

According to The Vanguard Group Inc.'s Form 13F-HR filed August 13, 2024, the firm holds 675.9 million shares valued at $302.09 billion (9.09% of outstanding shares). According to BlackRock Inc.'s June 30, 2024 13F filing, the company maintains 553.97 million shares worth $247.59 billion (7.45% of total shares). According to State Street Corporation's Q2 2024 disclosure, it holds 300.03 million shares valued at $134.09 billion (4% of outstanding shares).

These three institutional investors collectively control approximately 20.5% of Microsoft's outstanding shares, representing nearly $684 billion in combined holdings as of August 2024. Their substantial ownership positions provide significant influence over corporate governance decisions, including oversight of partnerships with foreign intelligence services.

According to Microsoft's SEC filings, the Azure and Intelligent Cloud segment contributed $34.1 billion in quarterly revenue during Q4 2024, with operating margins exceeding 45%. The Unit 8200 partnership represents an undisclosed portion of Microsoft's government and enterprise cloud contracts, which fall within the broader Azure ecosystem that has shown consistent 30% year-over-year growth.

### The Money Trail

While specific contract values for the Microsoft-Unit 8200 partnership remain undisclosed, Microsoft's overall cloud infrastructure business generated over $75 billion in Azure revenue during fiscal year 2024, according to the company's Form 10-K filing. The Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure services, reported operating income of $21.5 billion with gross margins of approximately 71% as of June 30, 2024.

The institutional investment network reveals significant exposure to Microsoft's operations through major asset managers. According to Vanguard's SEC filings, their 675.9 million Microsoft shares represent approximately 5.8% of Vanguard's total portfolio, making Microsoft the firm's largest single holding as of August 2024. BlackRock's 553.97 million share position reflects the company's status as BlackRock's top holding, representing substantial exposure for pension funds and institutional clients invested in BlackRock's index funds.

According to State Street Corporation's 13F-HR filing, their $134.09 billion Microsoft position affects numerous pension funds and institutional investors who hold State Street-managed index funds. These connections mean that public employee retirement systems, university endowments, and other institutional investors maintain indirect exposure to Microsoft's intelligence partnerships through their holdings in broad market index funds managed by these three firms.

According to SEC 13F-HR filings dated August 2024, the combined $684 billion in Microsoft holdings controlled by these three asset managers represents voting power that could influence corporate governance decisions related to international partnerships and human rights policies.
