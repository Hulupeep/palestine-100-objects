# Pal100 Community: Project Status & Scaling Vision

## üìö PHASE 1 FOUNDATION COMPLETED - SCALING TO 10,000

### Overview
The **Pal100 community** has completed the foundational documentation of 100 objects as Phase 1 of our urgent, community-driven preservation initiative. This comprehensive investigative chronicle examines Palestinian material culture through systematic object documentation, but **100 is just the beginning**. Our vision scales to 1,000 then 10,000 objects, creating the world's most comprehensive archive of Palestinian material culture.

**‚è∞ CRITICAL**: This is an urgent preservation project recognizing what may not survive the current situation. Every object documented becomes part of a permanent historical record for future generations.
